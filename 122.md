# Deadline check is missing, allowing outdated slippage and allow pending transaction to be executed unexpectedly

### Summary

Deadline check is missing while minting and burning LP tokens. This allows outdated slippage and pending transactions to be executed unexpectedly. Deadline check should be included in important functions.

### Root Cause

In the [`core.mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L155-L158) function, there is no deadline check. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is BTC/USDT (base/quote) pool.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice execute a transaction to add liquidity to the BTC/USDT pool.

### Impact

AMMs provide their users with an option to limit the execution of their pending actions, such as swaps or adding and removing liquidity. The most common solution is to include a deadline timestamp as a parameter (for example see Uniswap V2 and Uniswap V3). If such an option is not present, users can unknowingly perform bad trades.

### PoC

In the current implementation in [`core.mint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L155-L158), there is no deadline check.

Alice wants to add liquidity 1000 USDT to the BTC/USDT pool.
BTC/USDT pool has total reserves as 100K USDT. 

The transaction is submitted to the mempool, however, Alice chose a transaction fee that is too low for miners to be interested in including her transaction in a block. The transaction stays pending in the mempool for extended periods, which could be hours, days, weeks, or even longer.

When the average gas fee dropped far enough for Alice's transaction to become interesting again for miners to include it, her swap will be executed. In the meantime, the BTC/USDT pool's total reserves increased to 110K USDT. As a result, Alice would get much less LP tokens.

She has unknowingly performed a bad trade due to the pending transaction she forgot about.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to implement additional logic to check deadline in important functions.
