# oracle.vy::extract_price can accept stale prices because allow returned timestamp equals to previous price response timestamp

## Summary
oracle.vy::extract_price can accept stale prices because timestamp comparission accept a timestamp that equals the previous price response timestamp.

## Vulnerability Detail
extract_price could accept the same price response for an arbitrary ammount of time if the new response timestamp equals the previous registered timestamp.
oracle.vy defines TIMESTAMP (initially with 0 value) variable to keep track of previous price response.

oracle extract_price is used to retrieve price from oracle.
ts variable is assigned to latest oracle price response
```solidity
def extract_price(
    quote_decimals: uint256,
    payload       : Bytes[224]
) -> uint256:
  price: uint256 = 0
  ts   : uint256 = 0
  (price, ts) = self.EXTRACTOR.extractPrice(self.FEED_ID, payload)
```
Then this ts variable is compared to TIMESTAMP to see if the response is fresh:
```solidity
  (price, ts) = self.EXTRACTOR.extractPrice(self.FEED_ID, payload)

  # Redstone allows prices ~10 seconds old, discourage replay attacks
  assert ts >= self.TIMESTAMP, "ERR_ORACLE"	# <@=
```
However this comparission allows ts to equal TIMESTAMP, so a stalled price response can be utilized over and over
Eg:
Assume the latest response price timestamp is t1 (1725868056), now TIMESTAMP is updated to 1725868056
Then a day passed t2=(1728439581) and the oracle is stalled, extractPrice is called again.
Oracle response timestamp returns t1 so the comparission performed is:
```solidity
	# ts = 1725868056
	# TIMESTAMP = 1725868056
	assert ts >= self.TIMESTAMP, "ERR_ORACLE"
```
ie
```solidity
1725868056 >= 1725868056
```
So the stalled oracle response is accepted

## Impact
Comparission allows to accept stalled oracle responses

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove equal operator from comparission:
```solidity
def extract_price(
    quote_decimals: uint256,
    payload       : Bytes[224]
) -> uint256:
  price: uint256 = 0
  ts   : uint256 = 0
  (price, ts) = self.EXTRACTOR.extractPrice(self.FEED_ID, payload)

  # Redstone allows prices ~10 seconds old, discourage replay attacks
  assert ts > self.TIMESTAMP, "ERR_ORACLE"	# <@
```
