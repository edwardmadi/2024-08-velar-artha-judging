# Contracts can always be reinitialized

### Summary

`__init__2` reverts if `INITIALIZED == true` or if `msg.sender != DEPLOYER`.

But `init` never reverts, and sets `INITIALIZED` to `false`, and sets `DEPLOYER` to `msg.sender`.

Hence, anyone can call `__init__`, and then call `__init__2` with arbitrary calldata at any time.

This can be used to block any action until reinitialized (and then can be done again).

Can also be used to atomically liquidate healthy positions.

### Root Cause

Every `__init__` in the codebase sets INITIALIZED to `false`.

### Attack Path

1. 1 ETH = 2000 USD. Alice opens a 1000 USDT position with 1 WETH as collateral.

2. Bob changes oracle address via `api#__init__` to the one which returns price 1 WETH = 1 USDT, and liquidates Alice, seizing Alice's collateral.

### Impact

Theft of users' collateral by liquidating an otherwise healthy position.

### Mitigation

In all contracts with `__init__`, `self.INITIALIZED = False` line should be removed.
