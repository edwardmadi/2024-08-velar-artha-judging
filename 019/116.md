# The `api.close` function does not check the slippage for the paid amount of base and quote tokens.

### Summary

In the `api.close` function, it also checks slippage for price variance, but not for paid amounts of base and quote tokens.
The token amount that user should pay to close position can be changed by price variance and funding fees based on the imbalance between long and short interest.
Attackers can increase the funding fees user should pay by frontrunning.
As a result, position creator may have to pay more base and quote tokens than they expected.

### Root Cause

There is no slippage check of based token and quote tokens in the [`api.close`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L161-L183).

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice opens the long position and there is no price movement for all steps of this scenario.
2. After some time, Alice is about to close the position, allowing her to pay pay imbalance funding fees.
3. Bob(attacker) frontruns Alice : he opens the long position with large interest.
4. Next, Alice's transaction is processed, and she has to pay more imbalance funding fees by Bob.

### Impact

Position creators may have to pay more tokens than they expected.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Add the slippage checking of received amount of tokens in the `api.close` function.
