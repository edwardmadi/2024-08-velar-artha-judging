# Excess Tokens May Get Stuck in Contract


## Vulnerability Detail
 

Let's say a liquidity provider (LP) wants to provide liquidity in a pool that facilitates trading between BTC (Bitcoin) and USDT (Tether). 

Step 1: Check Pool Ratio
Suppose the pool currently has 100 BTC and 200,000 USDT. The ratio of BTC to USDT in the pool is 1 BTC = 2,000 USDT.

Step 2: Deposit Tokens
To maintain the pool's ratio, the LP needs to deposit tokens in the same proportion. Let's say the LP wants to deposit 10 BTC worth of liquidity.

BTC Deposit: The LP needs to deposit 10 BTC.
USDT Deposit: Since the ratio is 1 BTC = 2,000 USDT, the LP needs to deposit 10 BTC * 2,000 USDT/BTC = 20,000 USDT.
so the LP receives 10% of the total LP tokens.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
now imagine   you provide 1 BTC and 3,000 USDT to the liquidity pool with a 1BTC = 2,000 USDT ratio,

1. Function Call:
You'd call the mint function with `base_amt = 1BTC` and `quote_amt = 3,000 USDT`. The contract would process these inputs to provide liquidity to the pool.

2. Pool Conditions:
The pool expects liquidity to be provided in a specific ratio (1 BTC = 2,000 USDT). However, you're providing an extra 1,000 USDT beyond this ratio. 


3.Liquidity Minting:
Calculating LP Tokens (`calc_mint`): The contract will calculate the LP tokens to be minted using the `pools::calc_mint` function. It will calculate the total value of the pool (pv) and the value of your contribution (mv). The LP tokens minted will be proportional to your contribution relative to the total pool size.


4 . Minting LP Tokens:
Once the tokens have been transferred to the pool and the pool's state has been updated, the contract mints LP tokens.

now your extra 1000USTD is stuck in the contract without refunding to the user.
## Impact

- locked User Funds: Excess tokens could be stuck in the contract without contributing to liquidity, effectively locking user funds.
- Reduced LP Token Minting: Since the excess tokens are not properly accounted for, users may receive fewer LP tokens than expected, leading to an imbalance between liquidity provided and LP tokens minted.

## Recommendation

 consider the following approaches:

- Excess Token Refund: Automatically refund any excess tokens (e.g., the extra 1,000 USDT) to the user after the appropriate liquidity is added to the pool.
- Proportional Contribution Adjustment: Adjust the contribution proportionally to match the expected token ratio and use all provided liquidity effectively.
- Flexible Liquidity Addition: Allow the contract to add the excess tokens to the pool's reserves while ensuring it does not disrupt the balance and fairness of liquidity provisioning.
