# Protocol actions might revert because of tokens that revert on zero value transfer

## Summary
Some actions in the protocol transfer tokens without checking the amount to transfer, which might lead to unexpected revert issue when either base/quote token reverts on zero value transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
```vyper
@external
def mint(
  ...
  assert ERC20(base_token).transferFrom(user, self, base_amt, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
  assert ERC20(quote_token).transferFrom(user, self, quote_amt, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
  ...
```
In some actions like `mint`, the protocol transfers base and quote assets from the user to the pool by calling `transferFrom`.
However, it does not check if `base_amt` or `quote_amt` is zero. Some ERC20 tokens revert when transferring zero value between accounts.

If those tokens are integrated with Verla protocol, the protocol stops working.

## Impact
DoS of the protocol when base or quote asset token reverts on zero value transfer.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should check the token amount to transfer before it actually calls `transfer` or `transferFrom`.
