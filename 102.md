# Returned redstone prices not validated which can lead to protocol operations being run on bogus prices

## Summary

RedstoneExtractor doesn't fully validate the returned price and just uses it as is to conduct protocol operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `extractPrice`, the `getOracleNumericValuesAndTimestampFromTxMsg` function returns the price and timestamp. As can be seen, only the timestamp is validated. The returned price is not.

```solidity
  function extractPrice(bytes32 feedId, bytes calldata)
      public view returns(uint256, uint256)
  {
    bytes32[] memory dataFeedIds = new bytes32[](1);
    dataFeedIds[0] = feedId;
    (uint256[] memory values, uint256 timestamp) =
        getOracleNumericValuesAndTimestampFromTxMsg(dataFeedIds);
    validateTimestamp(timestamp); //!!!
    return (values[0], timestamp);
  }
}
```
If the price feed is manipulated in any way or in times of serious volatility on the market, the protocol operations will be run on these prices with which malicious users can use to gain a significant advantage. For instance, during liquidations, since liquidation bots are in use, the bots can sufficiently monitor the price feed and act on the volatile price, (for example, a price of 0, which is usually a subject to filtration), liquidating the trader position which is perfectly healthy otherwise, obtaining the collateral with a substantial discount at the expense of the trader.

## Impact

Protocol operations will be run on volatile prices, potentially zero prices, which can lead to various unintended consequences for the users.
