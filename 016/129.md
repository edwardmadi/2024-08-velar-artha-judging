# Liquidators lack incentives to close positions with zero payouts

## Summary

The liquidators do not liquidate positions with zero payouts, which can lead to further losses and positions go negative due to price fluctuations. Liquidators lack incentives to act as there is no profit from liquidating such positions.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the protocol attempts to calculate the value of a position to [check if it's liquidatable or not](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L352-L357), it first [deducts](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L249-L255) the `funding_paid` and `borrowing_paid` from the collateral:
```vyper
  c0              : uint256       = pos.collateral
  c1              : Val           = self.deduct(c0,           fees.funding_paid)
  c2              : Val           = self.deduct(c1.remaining, fees.borrowing_paid)
  # Funding fees prioritized over borrowing fees.
  funding_paid    : uint256       = c1.deducted
  borrowing_paid  : uint256       = c2.deducted
  remaining       : uint256       = c2.remaining
```

The remaining collateral is then used to [calculate the PnL](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L277-L279) of the position. If the remaining collateral becomes zero, the protocol [sets the payout to zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L295-L298) regardless of profits, funding received, or other factors:
```vyper
  # Positions whose collateral drops to zero due to fee obligations
  # are liquidated and don't receive a payout.
  final  : uint256       = 0 if remaining == 0 else (
                             0 if loss > remaining else (
                               remaining - loss if loss > 0 else (
                               remaining + profit ) ) )
```

Since the liquidation fee, which is paid to the liquidator, [is deducted from the payout amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L333-L334), a zero payout means liquidators have no incentive to liquidate the position. They would incur transaction fees with no profit.

## Impact

Positions with a zero payout will not be liquidated, which allows the position to incur further losses. This could eventually result in the positions go negative due to price fluctuations.

## Recommendation

Ensure that liquidators are always compensated, even for positions with zero payout due to fees, perhaps by covering the liquidation fee from elsewhere in the protocol.
