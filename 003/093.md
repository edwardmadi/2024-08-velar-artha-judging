# If position goes to 0, the funding fees it should've received are never redistributed and are forever stuck

## Summary
If position goes to 0, the funding fees it should've received are never redistributed and are forever stuck

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user position's collateral goes to 0, the user loses all of it, including any funding fees they should've received 
```vyper
  # 1) we penalize negative positions by setting their funding_received to zero
  funding_received: uint256       = 0 if remaining == 0 else (
    # 2) funding_received may add up to more than available collateral, and
    #    we will pay funding fees out on a first come first serve basis
                                    min(fees.funding_received, avail) )
```

However, the problem is that the amount they should've received is later not subtracted from the collateral and will remain permanently stuck.

For this reason, we can see that `FeesPaid` has a `funding_received_want` arg which is intended to be used for that exact reason but is actually never used.

## Impact
Loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the intended `funding_received_want` and subtract it from the collateral so it is not stuck and instead redistributed to LP providers
