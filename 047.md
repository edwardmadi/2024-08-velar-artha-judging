# User DOS after opening and closing 500 positions in the protocol

## Summary

The amount of concurrent opened positions by a user is tracked and increased on each new opened position, but the same data is not properly reduced when the positions are closed by either normal close or liquidations.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Positions.vy` has a hard constant value of 500 to check for MAX_POSITIONS

```vyper
MAX_POSITIONS : constant(uint256) = 500
```

This value is checked on each new position created here
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L147

```vyper
@external
def open(
  user      : address,
  pool      : uint256,
  long      : bool,
  collateral: uint256,
  leverage  : uint256,
  ctx       : Ctx) -> PositionState:
  ...
  assert Positions(self).get_nr_user_positions(user) <= MAX_POSITIONS
  assert self.PARAMS.is_legal_position(ps, pos)
 # position is inserted and the number tracking positions is increased for this user
  self.insert_user_position(user, pos.id)
  ...
```

In the equivalent close logic on `Positions.vy` the number of positions is not cleaned up and decreased accordingly

## Impact

This will lead to a user being unable to open more positions after reaching the max positions in the platform. This will lead to a DOS for any user just by normal usage of the platform.

## Code Snippet

Small test to reproduce the issue

```python
def test_positions_no_not_updated(setup, core, open, close, long, positions, VEL, STX):
    setup()

    tx = open(VEL, STX, True, d(10), 2, price=d(5), sender=long)
    no_positions_before = positions.get_nr_user_positions(long)
    print("number of positions opened after open: ", no_positions_before)
    chain.mine(10_000)

    tx = close(VEL, STX, 1, price=d(5), sender=long)
    assert not tx.failed
    
    no_positions_after = positions.get_nr_user_positions(long)
    print("number of positions opened after close: ", no_positions_after)
    # no of positions is not decreased after closing
    assert no_positions_before == no_positions_after

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a cleanup logic to decrease the number of positions for the user after closing a position in the protocol.
