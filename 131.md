# Denial of Service Attack on Liquidity Providers by Opening Feeless Small Positions Exploiting Low Reserve and Precision Loss

### Summary

An attacker can execute a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on liquidity providers by opening multiple feeless, small positions that consume the pool's reserves due to precision loss in the fee calculation. This makes the reserves insufficient for liquidity providers to burn their LP tokens. Since these small positions incur minimal or no fees and do not get liquidated due to their size, they can remain open for a prolonged period, effectively locking up the protocol's liquidity.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L203
The smart contract does not enforce a minimum position size requirement when users open positions. As a result, attackers can create very small positions that incur minimal or no fees due to precision loss in the fee calculations. This leads to numerous small positions consuming the protocol's reserves without contributing meaningful fees, preventing liquidity providers from burning their LP tokens or withdrawing liquidity.



### Internal pre-conditions

1.The protocol allows users to open positions of any size without a minimum requirement.
2.The fee calculation for opening positions does not account for very small amounts, leading to near-zero or zero fees due to precision loss.

### External pre-conditions

1.An attacker can interact with the protocol's smart contracts and is aware of the lack of a minimum position size requirement.
2.The protocol's reserves are finite and can be depleted by numerous small positions.


### Attack Path

1.The attacker identifies that the protocol allows users to open positions without any minimum size requirement, leading to feeless small positions.
2.The attacker uses a script or automation to open a large number of very small positions (e.g., 1,000 positions with 0.0001 USDT collateral each). Due to the lack of a minimum position size, these small positions are created successfully with zero or near-zero fees, consuming the protocol's reserves.
3.The cumulative effect of these small positions depletes the protocol's reserves, making them insufficient for liquidity providers to burn LP tokens or withdraw their liquidity.
4. Liquidity providers are unable to burn their LP tokens or withdraw liquidity due to the low reserve levels caused by the attacker's small positions.


### Impact

1.Denial of Service for Liquidity Providers: Liquidity providers are unable to withdraw their funds or burn their LP tokens due to insufficient reserves.
2.Protocol Instability: The protocolâ€™s operations may be disrupted, leading to a loss of trust and reduced liquidity provision.
3.Financial Losses: Liquidity providers and users may suffer financial losses as their funds remain locked in the protocol.
4. Long-Term Lockup: The attack can persist for a long period as small positions may not be liquidated due to their size, keeping the reserves low.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1.Set a minimum size for positions to prevent the creation of extremely small, feeless positions. This ensures that each position has a meaningful impact on the protocol's reserves.
2.Implement a queue for pending withdrawals and don't allow opening positions with big leverage until the queue is clear
