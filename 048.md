## Summary

Liquidations are an important part of the protocol invariants, it is crucial that they work correctly for all cases and in a timely manner to avoid bad debt.

In the protocol there are both base and quote tokens, initially is intended to use a tokenized
BTC as the base token and a bridged USDT version as the quote token in the BOB network.

The other major stablecoin in the BOB network for integration is USDC.

USDC is a bridged token in the BOB network with growing supply, and as is common for the USDC implementation to contain blacklist functionality which can revert some transfers.

Liquidations require transfers to work properly for sending remainder to the user and the liquidator, this can be a problem if the user opened one or more positions in a pool integrating USDC and later that user gets blacklisted in the USDC contract.

The user positions will revert on liquidation unable to close the positions in a timely manner which could put the protocol at risk of accruing bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

These are the addresses for Bridged USDC in the BOB network

The transfer method in the USDC contract has a check for blacklisted users that can revert the transfer.

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 value)
        external
        override
        whenNotPaused
        notBlacklisted(msg.sender)
        notBlacklisted(to) <-- This is the check that can revert the transfer
        returns (bool)
    {
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, value);
        return true;
    }
```

In the liquidation logic as part of the accounting, the fees are sent to the liquidator and any remaining balance of both base and quote token is sent back to the owner of the position.

If the user is blacklisted in the USDC contract the transfer will revert and the liquidation will fail.

## Impact

Liquidations will fail to work properly and in a timely manner if a user with several open positions is later blacklisted in the USDC contract.

This could lead to bad debt in the protocol and a risk of insolvency since the calculations for when a position is liquidatable are based on the current state of the position and price, if there is a big price fluctuation the position will fail liquidation until the position remaining for the user reaches 0, which could have consequences for the liquidation fee also being 0 and liquidators not being incentivized to liquidate the position.

Furthermore, the position could reach such bad state that by the time the position is able to be liquidated the invariants check may fail further reverting the liquidation.

## Code Snippet

```vyper
@external
def liquidate(
  id         : uint256,
  base_token : address,
  quote_token: address,
  position_id: uint256,
  ctx        : Ctx) -> PositionValue:
 ...

  # important that all these transfers never revert
  if base_amt_final.fee > 0:
    assert ERC20(base_token).transfer(user, base_amt_final.fee, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
  if quote_amt_final.fee > 0:
    assert ERC20(quote_token).transfer(user, quote_amt_final.fee, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
  if base_amt_final.remaining > 0:
    assert ERC20(base_token).transfer(position.user, base_amt_final.remaining, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
  if quote_amt_final.remaining > 0:
    assert ERC20(quote_token).transfer(position.user, quote_amt_final.remaining, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20" <-- important that these transfers never revert

  self.INVARIANTS(id, base_token, quote_token)

  log Liquidate(user, ctx, pool, value)
  return value
```

## Recommendation

Consider carefully which tokens to integrate on POOLS specifically on tokens that can be upgraded or blacklisted that could affect the liquidation process.
