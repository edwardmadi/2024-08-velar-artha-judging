# Slippage isn't implmented properly on mint() and burn() functions

## Summary 
Slippage isn't implmented properly on `mint()` and `burn()` functions especially on `burn()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Slippage is enforced by using price discreprancy in `oracle.vy` (current price, desired price and slippage ), so current slippage implementation helps check sudden price movement not actual token payout. But in `pool.vy` the actual amount that `core.vy` pays out the LP provider when minting and burning LP tokens  is calculated using the total pool value in the form of quote tokens and current circulating LP tokens  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L163-L178  ,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L213-L228 , the issue is that current circulating LP tokens and pool reserve will be changing constantly because of minting, burning and closing positions (especially profitable ones). 

## Proof of concept and impact 
Let's look at this scenario ; User wants to burn 100 Lp tokens he currently checks `pool.calc_burn()` a view function  for how much USDT he will get in return (converting pool value to usdt) . Let's assign some varaibles; lp token total supply = 1000; pool reserve value in usdt = 2000.
Using the calculation in the link I pasted above (lp * pv) /ts = (100 * 2000) / 1000 = 200 usdt will be returned as the result. 
Happy with the result he goes ahead to call burn in `apy.vy` to burn 100 lp tokens but before he called it a profitable trader closed their positions taking out a net 1,000 usdt value out of the pool (I used 'net' because the collateral the trader deposited is absorbed into the pool reserve ).
Then as the user that wants to burn calls `burn()` new pay out value is calculated as (100 * 1000)/ 1000 = 100.  So Lp provider ends up getting 100 USDT instead of 200 and there was no slippage to ensure he will get 200 as the price of tokens do not affect the value in the pool. 

## Tools Used 
Manual Review 

## Recommendation
Set a minimum amount of quote/LP tokens user is supposed to expect
