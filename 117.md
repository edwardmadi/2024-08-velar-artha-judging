# If the position creator is blocklisted for USDT, the position for USDT quote token can not be liquidated

### Summary

When the short position is closed or liquidated, the protocol transfers the quote tokens to the position creator.
If the creator is blocklisted for USDT, the position can not be closed and liquidated.
As a result, `pos.interest` amount of tokens are locked and protocol can not use them until transferring amount is zero.

### Root Cause

In the [`core.vy:344`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L344), the protocol attempts to transfer quote tokens regardless of whether the owner of the position is blocklisted.

### Internal pre-conditions

There is BTC/USDT (base/quote) pool.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice open the short position.
2. Alice is blocklisted for `USDT`.
3. Alice's position can not be closed.
4. Liquidation is reverted as long as `quote_amt_final.remaining > 0`.

### Impact

`pos.interest` amount of tokens are locked and protocol can not use them until `quote_amt_final.remaining = 0` and the position is liquidated.

### PoC

Alice can not close the position because she can not receive USDT tokens from [L299](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L299).

```vyper
298:   if quote_amt > 0:
299:     assert ERC20(quote_token).transfer(user, quote_amt, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
```

Liquidation is reverted as long as `quote_amt_final.remaining > 0` from [L344](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L344).

```vyper
343:   if quote_amt_final.remaining > 0:
344:     assert ERC20(quote_token).transfer(position.user, quote_amt_final.remaining, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
```

### Mitigation

In the `core.liquidate` function, it is recommended to record the amount of tokens to transfer to the owner of the position and add a function to withdraw them for position owners.
