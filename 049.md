# Missing critical input validations when setting protocol parameters

## Summary

The `Params.vy` contract stores the protocol parameters that are used in critical checks like minimum or maximum collateral
for positions, minimum and maximum leverage, liquidation threshold to trigger liquidations, etc.

All of these are set and updated via a Params struct which in Vyper is basically a tuple of 13 uint256 values, the order and positioning of these values is critical.

All of these are set and updated atomically with a single method by the owner of the contract, the method has no input validations for any of the arguments. Furthermore, when updating one of these critical values it is required that all other values are sent as well to be overwritten or preserve.

An incorrect update or bad positioning of a single of these values could lead to the protocol to stop working as expected or trigger liquidations incorrectly, losing funds for users in the process.

## Vulnerability Detail

The definition of the Parameters struct is found here

```vyper
# params.vy
struct Parameters:
  # Fees are stored as a numerator, with the denominator defined in math.vy.
  #
  # Min fee example for 5 second blocks:
  #  1 year     = 6324480 blocks
  #  10% / year ~ 0.000_0016% / block
  #  in math.vy representation: 16
  #
  # Max fee example for 5 second blocks:
  #   8h      = 5760 blocks
  #   4% / 8h ~ 0.000_7% / block
  #   in math.vy representation: 7_000
  #
  MIN_FEE               : uint256
  MAX_FEE               : uint256

  # Fraction of collateral (e.g. 1000).
  PROTOCOL_FEE          : uint256

  # Fraction of remaining collateral (e.g. 2)
  LIQUIDATION_FEE       : uint256

  # Depend on coin decimals.
  MIN_LONG_COLLATERAL   : uint256
  MAX_LONG_COLLATERAL   : uint256
  MIN_SHORT_COLLATERAL  : uint256
  MAX_SHORT_COLLATERAL  : uint256

  # E.g. 1 and 10.
  MIN_LONG_LEVERAGE     : uint256
  MAX_LONG_LEVERAGE     : uint256
  MIN_SHORT_LEVERAGE    : uint256
  MAX_SHORT_LEVERAGE    : uint256

  # C.f. is_liquidatable, e.g. 1.
  LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD : uint256
```

The comments indicate what are reasonable values for these parameters, but the contract does not enforce these values.

The method to update these parameters is found here
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/params.vy#L25

```vyper
@external
def set_params(new_params: Parameters):
  assert msg.sender == self.DEPLOYER, ERR_PERMISSIONS
  self.PARAMS = new_params
```

The method does not check if the new_params are within reasonable ranges or values that are immediately harmful to the operation of the protocol.

For example `MIN_LONG_COLLATERAL` is not checked that is higher than 0 or lower than `MAX_LONG_COLLATERAL`. 

This is also the case for all the other MIN and MAX value pairs that need a relationship between them to be lower and higher respectively.

This is important because the params are used in every single operation for opening, closing and liquidating positions.

The other critical parameter is `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` which is used to trigger liquidations, if this value is set too high, liquidations will be triggered too soon and users will lose funds. This can happen immediately after a parameters update, and all healthy positions will become liquidated assuming bot automation for liquidations.

Furthermore, the `LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` can be set to 0 which means that no liquidations will ever be triggered because of the way it impacts this code check:

```vyper
@external
@view
def is_liquidatable(position: PositionState, pnl: PnL) -> bool:
    """
    A position becomes liquidatable when its current value is less than
    a configurable fraction of the initial collateral, scaled by
    leverage.
    """
    # Assume liquidation bots are able to check and liquidate positions
    # every N seconds.
    # We would like to avoid the situation where a position's value goes
    # negative (due to price fluctuations and fee obligations) during
    # this period.
    # Roughly, the most a positions value can change is
    #   leverage * asset price variance + fees
    # If N is small, this expression will be ~the price variance.
    # E.g. if N = 60 and we expect a maximal price movement of 1%/minute
    # we could set LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD to 1 (* some constant to be on the
    # safe side).
    percent : uint256 = self.PARAMS.LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD * position.leverage <-- this should never be 0 or a very high value
    required: uint256 = (position.collateral * percent) / 100
    return not (pnl.remaining > required)
```

## Impact

The likelihood of this issue is not high because it requires the owner of the contract to incorrectly set these values, but the impact is critical because it can lead to the protocol to stop working as expected or trigger liquidations incorrectly, losing funds for users in the process.

The fact that the method to update these parameters is coupled for all critical values and that updating one value requires to update all of them, plus the lack of input validations for these values compounds the risk of this issue.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add granular methods to set individual critical parameters with input validations for the values that are set, and add a check that the values are within reasonable ranges and correct relationships between them are maintained.
