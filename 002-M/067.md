# wrong implement of "is_liquidatable"

## Summary
if pnl.remaining ==required then it will be liquidatable.
## Vulnerability Detail
def is_liquidatable(position: PositionState, pnl: PnL) -> bool:
    """
    A position becomes liquidatable when its current value is less than
    a configurable fraction of the initial collateral, scaled by
    leverage.
    """
    # Assume liquidation bots are able to check and liquidate positions
    # every N seconds.
    # We would like to avoid the situation where a position's value goes
    # negative (due to price fluctuations and fee obligations) during
    # this period.
    # Roughly, the most a positions value can change is
    #   leverage * asset price variance + fees
    # If N is small, this expression will be ~the price variance.
    # E.g. if N = 60 and we expect a maximal price movement of 1%/minute
    # we could set LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD to 1 (* some constant to be on the
    # safe side).
    percent : uint256 = self.PARAMS.LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD * position.leverage
    required: uint256 = (position.collateral * percent) / 100
@>>    return not (pnl.remaining > required)
## Impact
pnl.remaining ==required then it will be liquidatable.
