# The oracle doesn't check for unreasonably high prices

### Details

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy#L128

in `check_price` function in the `oracle.vy`  :

```python
@internal
@pure
def check_price(price: uint256) -> bool:
  return price > 0
```

The function only checks if the price is greater than zero, but it doesn't check for unreasonably high prices. This could lead to potential issues in the system if an extremely high price is reported by the oracle.

In a decentralized finance (DeFi) system dealing with leveraged positions, it's crucial to have safeguards against extreme price movements, whether they're legitimate market events or the result of oracle manipulation.

The impact on the project could be severe:

- An extremely high price could trigger unnecessary liquidations for short positions.

- Incorrect PnL Calculations: The system calculates profit and loss based on these prices. An unreasonably high price could lead to incorrect calculations, potentially allowing users to extract more value from the system than they should.

- Extreme prices could lead to imbalanced pool states, affecting the overall health and stability of the system.

- Malicious actors could potentially exploit this to manipulate the system's state in their favor.


## mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, the `check_price` function should also include an upper bound check. For example:

```python
@internal
@view  
def check_price(price: uint256) -> bool:
  return price > 0 and price <= self.MAX_ACCEPTABLE_PRICE
```

Where `MAX_ACCEPTABLE_PRICE` is a carefully chosen upper limit that allows for significant price movements but prevents unreasonable values. This limit could be dynamically adjusted based on market conditions or set by governance.

By implementing this additional check, the system would be more robust against extreme price events or potential oracle manipulations, enhancing the overall security and stability of the protocol.
