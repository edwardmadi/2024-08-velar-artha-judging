# Funding rate will be lost if there's no positions on one of the sides

## Summary
Funding rate will be lost if there's no positions on one of the sides

## Vulnerability Detail
The way funding rate works is that the side which has larger utilization pays a funding fee to the other side's position holders. The exact amount is based on the delta of both utilization percentages.

```vyper
@internal
@view
def funding_fee(base_fee: uint256, col1: uint256, col2: uint256) -> uint256:
  imb: uint256 = self.imbalance(col1, col2)
  if imb == 0: return 0
  else       : return self.check_fee(self.scale(base_fee, imb))
```

The problem lies in the situation where there's only position on one side. In this case said position holders will pay the funding fees, but no one will actually receive them and they'll be permanently stuck in the contract, marked as `collateral`

## Impact

## Recommendation
