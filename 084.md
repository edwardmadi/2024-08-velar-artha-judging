# Current slippage protection forces transaction to revert if price is too good.

## Summary
Current slippage protection forces transaction to revert if price is too good.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user wishes to open a position, they specify a desired price and the max slippage they're willing to accept.
The current implementation is that if the delta of the desired price and the actual price is more than the max slippage, the transaction reverts

```vyper
def check_slippage(current: uint256, desired: uint256, slippage: uint256) -> bool:
  if current > desired: return (current - desired) <= slippage
  else                : return (desired - current) <= slippage
```

The problem is that this doesn't take into account the situation where the price has moved more than slippage in the right direction for the user.
For example, if the user wishes to open a long with desired price $1 and max slippage they've set is $0.10 and price drops to $0.8, current implementation would revert, although it shouldn't - user would only benefit if they could open their long position at a lower price. 

Same thing for shorts if the price has increased prior to opening the position.

This is basically the equivalent of a swap transaction failing due to receiving more tokens than specified.

## Impact
DoS, loss of funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Depending on whether the position is long or short, check for price movements only in certain direction
