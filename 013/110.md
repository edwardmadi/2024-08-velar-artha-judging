# Blacklisted Users Cannot Be Liquidated

## Summary
Users blacklisted by the base or quote token cannot be liquidated, as the liquidation function will revert when attempting to transfer tokens to the blacklisted user.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the liquidation process, any remaining tokens are transferred back to the user being liquidated. However, if the user is blacklisted by either the base or quote token, these transfers will fail, causing the entire liquidation transaction to revert:

[core.vy#L341-L344](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L341-L344)
```solidity
  if base_amt_final.remaining > 0:
    assert ERC20(base_token).transfer(position.user, base_amt_final.remaining, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
  if quote_amt_final.remaining > 0:
    assert ERC20(quote_token).transfer(position.user, quote_amt_final.remaining, default_return_value=True), "ERR_ERC20"
```

If `position.user` is blacklisted, these transfers will fail, and the assert statements will cause the transaction to revert.

## Impact
Blacklisted users' positions cannot be liquidated, potentially leaving the protocol with bad debt and affecting its overall solvency.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a pull-based mechanism for liquidated users to retrieve their funds, replacing the current push-based approach.
