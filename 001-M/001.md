# Unsafe use of tx.origin in the mint function will leading to unauthorized LP token minting

### Summary

The use of `tx.origin` in the [`mint` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L166) of the Velar protocol allows for a phishing attack. If a user grants unlimited allowance to the contract for `base_token` and `quote_token`, a malicious contract can execute the `mint` function on their behalf, resulting in unauthorized minting of LP tokens. The root cause is the use of `tx.origin` to determine the user, which is unsafe as it can be manipulated by intermediate contracts.

### Root Cause

In [`core.vy:166`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L166) there is an unsafe use of `tx.origin` as it can cause unauthorized minting.
The choice to use tx.origin may be because of `api.vy` contract between user and `core.vy` contract. There is a good explaination of why it is unsafe in the Solidity documentation: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/security-considerations.html#tx-origin.

The `mint` function in `API.vy` allows users to mint LP tokens by depositing `base_token` and `quote_token` into the contract. The function uses `tx.origin` to identify the user initiating the transaction:

```python
user : address = tx.origin
```

This design is problematic because `tx.origin` represents the original sender of the transaction, not necessarily the direct caller. In scenarios where a user interacts with another contract that in turn calls the `mint` function, `tx.origin` will still point to the original user. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The victim must have granted an allowance to the core contract address for both `base_token` and `quote_token`, enabling the contract to transfer tokens on the victim's behalf.

2. The victim must initiate a transaction with a smart contract that allows the attacker to indirectly call the `mint` function at any point during the transaction. This can be easily achieved, for example, if the victim interacts with an automated router like Uniswap's that swaps tokens based on optimal trade routes. The attacker could create a malicious token involved in the trade, and within the `transfer` function of this malicious token, the attacker can execute a call to the Velor protocol's `mint` function. Because `tx.origin` will still refer to the victim, the Velor protocol will perceive the transaction as initiated by the victim.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

If a user has set an unlimited allowance for `base_token` and `quote_token` to this contract, a malicious contract can execute a phishing attack by:

1. Encouraging the user to initiate a transaction on the malicious contract. As explained in internal pre-conditions, it is not hard.
2. Having the malicious contract call the `mint` function on `API.vy`.
3. Using `tx.origin` to transfer tokens from the userâ€™s address to the contract, minting new LP tokens without the user's explicit consent.


### Impact

- **Unauthorized Token Minting:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to force a user to mint LP tokens, leading to unauthorized token movements, and potential **loss of funds**.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, replace `tx.origin` with a `user` parameter passed to the `mint` function. This parameter should be set by the `msg.sender` when the `API.vy` contract calls the function. The updated function signature should look like this:

```python
@external
def mint(
  user        : address,
  id          : uint256,
  base_token  : address,
  quote_token : address,
  lp_token    : address,
  base_amt    : uint256,
  quote_amt   : uint256,
  ctx         : Ctx) -> uint256:
```

Additionally, the contract call on `api.vy:101` should be updated to:

```python
  return self.CORE.mint(msg.sender, 1, base_token, quote_token, lp_token, base_amt, quote_amt, ctx)
```

By passing `msg.sender` as the `user`, the function ensures that only the immediate caller is authorized to initiate the minting process, thus preventing phishing attacks.
