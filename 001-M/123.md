# The use of `tx.origin` may cause a trader to lose funds

## Summary

Traders interact with the protocol through calls to the `api.vy` contract. Every interaction is then forwarded to the `core.vy` contract which is responsible for identifying the trader's address, pulling tokens from the address and performing the desired operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue comes from the fact that the `core.vy` contract identifies the trader using `tx.origin`. This can lead to unexpected and undesirable behaviors especially when using `Smart Contract Wallets` (`Gnosis Safe` ; `Abstract Accounts` ; ...)

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L241>

```python
@external
def open(
  id          : uint256,
  base_token  : address,
  quote_token : address,
  long        : bool,
  collateral0 : uint256,
  leverage    : uint256,
  ctx         : Ctx) -> PositionState:

  self._INTERNAL()

@>  user       : address   = tx.origin
```

Let the following scenario :
- a trader owns a `Smart Contract Wallet`, with 3 other traders, that holds 4,000 USDT
- the trader also holds 5,000 USDT
- the trader tries to use the protocol and `approve()` the `core.vy` contract to pull `type(uint256).max` amount of `USDT`
- the trader opens a position with 100 USDT
- now the traders that own the smart wallet are confident and want to commit 3,000 USDT from their smart wallet
- they all sign the required set of transactions to `open()` a position in Velar (e.g. `USDT.approve()`)
- the initial trader triggers the set of transactions with the intention to open a position for the smart wallet
- Velar identifies the trader with `tx.origin` and performs the `open()` for the trader's address, not the smart wallet

The initial trader commited 3,000 USDT from his own tokens in Velar

He is now subjected to price fluctuation of the market and has an additional position opened, which he did not intend to.

## Impact

This design can potentially cause a loss of funds for the protocol users, performing internal operations with the address that initiated the transaction rather than a potential third party contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In `api.vy` retrieve `msg.sender` and forward this address as a new parameter in all `core.vy` functions.

For example :

*`api.vy`*

```diff
@external
def open(
    base_token  : address,
    quote_token : address,
    long        : bool,
    collateral0 : uint256,
    leverage    : uint256, # @audit does setting it to 0 break something? A : can't set it to 0
    desired     : uint256,
    slippage    : uint256,
    payload     : Bytes[224]
) -> PositionState:

    ctx: Ctx = self.CONTEXT(base_token, quote_token, desired, slippage, payload)
-   return self.CORE.open(1, base_token, quote_token, long, collateral0, leverage, ctx)
+   return self.CORE.open(1, base_token, quote_token, long, collateral0, leverage, msg.sender, ctx)
```

*`core.vy`*

```diff
@external
def open(
    id          : uint256,
    base_token  : address,
    quote_token : address,
    long        : bool,
    collateral0 : uint256,
    leverage    : uint256,
+   user        : address,
    ctx         : Ctx) -> PositionState:

    self._INTERNAL()
-   user       : address   = tx.origin
```
