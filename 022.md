# Initialization Vulnerability in core.vy Contract

## Summary

The `core.vy` contract has a potential security vulnerability where critical functions can be invoked before the contract has been fully initialized. This could lead to inconsistent behavior and unintended consequences if the contract is used prior to completing its initialization via the `__init__2` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

While the contract includes an `__init__2` function to complete setup, which can only be called once, there is no restriction that prevents users from calling other critical functions such as `fresh`, `mint`, `burn`, `open`, `close`, and `liquidate` before initialization is complete.

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to:
- Unauthorized operations: Functions relying on initialized state may operate incorrectly or fail silently.
- Damage to contract state: Uninitialized state variables could lead to corrupted data, making the contract malfunction.
- Financial risk: Users interacting with the contract before it is fully set up could lose funds or cause the system to become financially unstable.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L136-L151
```python
@external
def fresh(
  symbol: String[65],
  base_token: address,
  quote_token: address,
  lp_token: address):
@>  # Missing initialization check here
  assert msg.sender == self.DEPLOYER, ERR_PERMISSIONS
  ...
```

## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement an initialization guard to ensure that critical functions cannot be called before the contract has been fully initialized. This can be done by adding an `_initialized` internal method that checks the `INITIALIZED` state variable and integrating this check into all critical external functions.

### Recommended Code Change

1. **Add Initialization Check**:

```python
@internal
def _initialized():
    assert self.INITIALIZED, "ERR_NOT_INITIALIZED"
```

2. **Modify Critical Functions**:

Ensure the initialization check is called before executing any core logic:

```python
@external
def fresh(
  symbol: String[65],
  base_token: address,
  quote_token: address,
  lp_token: address):
    
  self._initialized()  # Ensure the contract is initialized
  assert msg.sender == self.DEPLOYER, "ERR_PERMISSIONS"
  assert not self.POOLS.exists_pair(base_token, quote_token), "ERR_PRECONDITIONS"
  ...
```

Apply the same change to other critical functions:

```python
@external
def mint(...) -> uint256:
  self._initialized()  # Ensure the contract is initialized
  self._INTERNAL()
  ...

@external
def burn(...) -> Tokens:
  self._initialized()  # Ensure the contract is initialized
  self._INTERNAL()
  ...

@external
def open(...) -> PositionState:
  self._initialized()  # Ensure the contract is initialized
  self._INTERNAL()
  ...

@external
def close(...) -> PositionValue:
  self._initialized()  # Ensure the contract is initialized
  self._INTERNAL()
  ...

@external
def liquidate(...) -> PositionValue:
  self._initialized()  # Ensure the contract is initialized
  self._INTERNAL()
  ...
```
