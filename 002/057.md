# `is_liquidatable` function in Params.vy is open to unfair liquidation of users

## Summary
[is_liquidatable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/params.vy#L119) function in `Params.vy` is not handling an edge case, which will result in liquidating users
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows anyone to liquidate a position by calling the function [liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L186) in api.vy, which contains a chain of calls. It firstly calls to the same named function in Core.vy. Core's liquidate function makes a [call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L325) to `is_liquidatable()` function in Positions.vy, which is defined as:
```python
@external
@view
def is_liquidatable(id: uint256, ctx: Ctx) -> bool:
  """
  Determines whether position `id` is liquidatable at `ctx.price`.
  """
  v: PositionValue = Positions(self).value(id, ctx)
  return self.PARAMS.is_liquidatable(v.position, v.pnl)
```
In this function there is another call made to `is_liquidatable()` in Params.vy. Now let's have a look on this function:
```python
@external
@view
def is_liquidatable(position: PositionState, pnl: PnL) -> bool:
    """
    A position becomes liquidatable when its current value is less than
    a configurable fraction of the initial collateral, scaled by
    leverage.
    """
    percent : uint256 = self.PARAMS.LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD * position.leverage
    required: uint256 = (position.collateral * percent) / 100
    return not (pnl.remaining > required) #@audit not handles equality correctly, unfair liq for user
```
Both from the comment in the function and the check in the end, it can be seen the position will be liquidated when  `pnl.remaining  = required`. However , logically if the remaining value is equal to the required value, the position should not be liquidated. Imagine a user has realized his position is at the threshold and decided to take an action, but before he takes an action, the position may be liquidated due the wrong check.
## Impact
Users will be faced by  unfair liquidation. The impact is high, the likelihood is low due the edge case. Hence Ä± believe it deserves medium severity

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Adjust the check in params.vy:is_liquidatable() as :
```python
@external
@view
def is_liquidatable(position: PositionState, pnl: PnL) -> bool:
     percent : uint256 = self.PARAMS.LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD * position.leverage
    required: uint256 = (position.collateral * percent) / 100
-    return not (pnl.remaining > required)
+   return pnl.remaining < required

```
