# Premature Liquidation Due to Wrong Check in `params.is_liquidatable()`

## Summary
The `is_liquidatable` function in `params.vy` incorrectly considers positions as liquidatable when the remaining collateral exactly equals the required amount, leading to unnecessary liquidations.  

## Vulnerability Detail
[params.vy#L138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/params.vy#L138)
```vyper
return not (pnl.remaining > required)
```

This condition returns true when `pnl.remaining` is less than or equal to required. As a result, positions where the remaining collateral exactly matches the required amount `(pnl.remaining == required)` are marked as liquidatable.

## Impact
Users whose positions have exactly the required collateral can be liquidated. This leads to unnecessary losses for these users. It also creates opportunities for malicious actors to trigger liquidations on positions that should still be considered safe.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the condition to allow positions with exactly the required collateral to remain safe:

```diff
- return not (pnl.remaining > required)
+ return pnl.remaining < required
```
