# LPs cannot specify min amount received in burn function, causing loss of fund for them

### Summary
LPs cannot set minimum base or quote amounts when burning LP tokens, leading to potential losses due to price fluctuations during transactions.

### Root Cause
LPs cannot set the base received amount and the quote received amount

### Impact
LPs may receive significantly lower amounts than expected when burning LP tokens, resulting in financial losses

### Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L104
### Internal pre-conditions
Consider change config in tests/conftest.py
I do it for better understanding,Fee doesn't important in this issue
```python
PARAMS = {
  'MIN_FEE'               : 0,
  'MAX_FEE'               : 0,

  'PROTOCOL_FEE'          : 1000
    ...
}
```
### PoC
**Textual PoC:**
we assume protocol fee is zero in this example
1-Bob mints 20,000e6 LP token[base_reserve:10,000e6, quote_reserve:10,000e6]
2-Alice opens long position[collateral 1000 STX, LEV:5,Price:1]
3-Price goes up til $2
4-Bob calls calc_burn[lp_amt:10,000e6,total_supply:20,000e6][return value:base 3750 VEL,quote 7500 STX]
5-Bob calls burn with above parameters
6-Alice calls close position
7-Alice's tx executed before Bob's tx
8-Bob's tx will be executed and Bob gets 3875 VEL and 4750 STX
9-Bob losts $2500
**Coded PoC:**
place this test in tests/test_positions.py and run this command `pytest -k test_lost_assets -s`
```python

def test_lost_assets(setup, VEL, STX, lp_provider, LP, pools, math, open, long, close, burn):
    setup()
    #Alice opens position
    open(VEL, STX, True, d(1000), 5, price=d(1), sender=long)
    
    reserve = pools.total_reserves(1)
    assert reserve.base == 10000e6
    assert reserve.quote == 10000e6
    #Bob calls calc_burn, Bob's assets in term of dollar is $15,000
    amts = pools.calc_burn(1, d(10000)  , d(20000), ctx(d(2)))
    
    assert amts.base == 3752500000
    assert amts.quote == 7495000000

    #Alice closes her position
    bef = VEL.balanceOf(long)
    close(VEL, STX, 1, price=d(2), sender=long)
    after = VEL.balanceOf(long)

    vel_bef = VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider)
    stx_bef = STX.balanceOf(lp_provider)

    amts = pools.calc_burn(1, d(10000)  , d(20000), ctx(d(2)))
    assert amts.base == 3877375030
    assert amts.quote == 4747749964
    #Bob's tx will be executed
    burn(VEL, STX, LP, d(10000), price=d(2), sender=lp_provider)

    vel_after = VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider)
    stx_after = STX.balanceOf(lp_provider)


    print("vel_diff:", (vel_after - vel_bef) / 1e6)#3877.37503 VEL
    print("stx_diff:", (stx_after - stx_bef) / 1e6)#4747.749964 STX
    #received values in term of dollar is ~ $12,500,Bob lost ~ $2500
```

### Mitigation

Consider adding min_base_amount and min_quote_amount to the burn function's params or adding min_assets_value for example when the price is $2 LPs set this param to $14800, its mean received value worse has to be greater than $14800
