# Users won't be able to open a position when `PROTOCOL_FEE = 0`

## Summary
If the `PROTOCOL_FEE` is set to 0 which is possible then it will not let users open a position in the pool with 0 PROTOCOL_FEE
## Vulnerability Detail
The [open](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L230-L268) function in `core.vy` is used to open the position and while doing so it fetches the [static_fees/Protocol fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L244) which is then further transferred to the protocol from the user.

Now if we see the implementation of [static_fees function in PARAMA.vy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/params.vy#L93-L97)

```python
@external
@view
def static_fees(collateral: uint256) -> Fee:
  fee      : uint256 = collateral / self.PARAMS.PROTOCOL_FEE
  remaining: uint256 = collateral - fee
  return Fee({x: collateral, fee: fee, remaining: remaining})
```

In the above function the fee calculation is done as   
`fee      : uint256 = collateral / self.PARAMS.PROTOCOL_FEE` 
The collateral is divided by `PROTOCOL_FEE`, now if the `PROTOCOL_FEE = 0` then the whole function will just panic revert due to division by 0 and so the whole open function will revert due to this and due to which users will not be able to open any positions in a pool with 0 `PROTOCOL_FEE`.
## Impact
users will not be able to open any positions in a pool with 0 `PROTOCOL_FEE`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a logic in `static_fees` funciton to handle 0 `PROTOCOL_FEE`.
