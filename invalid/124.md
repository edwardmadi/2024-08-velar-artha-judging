# An attacker can call init again after the develper calls it and become the deployer  and set variables and will be able to steal funds

## Summary
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L36
Since there is no access control in `__init()`, an attacker can take over the deployer and make the oracle or any address that is set using `__init__2` manipulated and attacker-controlled leading to stealing of funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
After a few weeks, the protocol's tvl goes to 1 million and then an attacker calls `__init__` making them the deployer, and then calls `__init__2` and changes the oracle to give a very low price for a long position and then a block later, the attacker closes the position with BTC at a very high price stealing all the funds in the pool.
```solidity
  assert msg.sender == self.DEPLOYER, ERR_INVARIANTS
  assert not self.INITIALIZED       , ERR_INVARIANTS
  self.INITIALIZED = True
```
## Impact
LP fund loss 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
def __init__():
  self.DEPLOYER    = msg.sender
  self.INITIALIZED = False

@external
def __init__2(
  math     : address,
  params   : address,
  pools    : address,
  fees     : address,
  positions: address,
  collector: address,
  api      : address):

  assert msg.sender == self.DEPLOYER, ERR_INVARIANTS
  assert not self.INITIALIZED, ERR_INVARIANTS
  self.INITIALIZED = True

  self.MATH        = Math(math)
  self.PARAMS      = Params(params)
  self.POOLS       = Pools(pools)
  self.FEES        = Fees(fees)
  self.POSITIONS   = Positions(positions)
  self.COLLECTOR   = collector
  self.API         = api
### api contract 
  self.ORACLE = Oracle(oracle)
  self.CORE   = Core(core)
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Put the Initialized section of the `__init__2` in the `__init__` to make sure after the deployer is set no one else can deploy. Otherwise take out the ``  self.INITIALIZED = False```, because when the contract is deployed it would be false any way.
