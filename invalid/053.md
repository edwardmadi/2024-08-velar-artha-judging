# Attacker will receive incorrect token distribution causing loss to liquidity providers

### Summary

A negative value calculation in the [`balanced` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/math.vy#L127-L158) will cause incorrect token distribution for liquidity providers as an attacker can manipulate the `burn_value` to be close to `state.base_excess_as_quote` or `state.quote_excess_as_quote`.


### Root Cause

In [`gl-sherlock/contracts/math.vy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/math.vy#L127-L158) the calculation of `left` can result in a negative value, which is then used in further calculations leading to incorrect token distribution.

- In `gl-sherlock/contracts/math.vy`:
  - [`balanced` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/math.vy#L143-L144) : `left` is calculated as `burn_value - state.base_excess_as_quote` or `burn_value - quote1`, which can be negative.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `burn_value` needs to be close to `state.base_excess_as_quote` or `state.quote_excess_as_quote`.
2. The pool needs to be in an imbalanced state (either `have_more_base` is true or false).


### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls [`burn` function in `core.vy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L191-L226) with a carefully chosen `lp_amt` that results in a `burn_value` close to `state.base_excess_as_quote` or `state.quote_excess_as_quote`.
2. The [`calc_burn` function in `pools.vy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L211-L224) calls the `balanced` function in `math.vy`.
3. The `balanced` function calculates a negative value for `left`.
4. The negative `left` value is used in further calculations, resulting in incorrect token distribution.


### Impact

The liquidity providers suffer an approximate loss proportional to the difference between the correct token distribution and the incorrect one returned by the `balanced` function. This could range from minimal to significant depending on the pool's state and the burn amount.

### PoC

1. Consider a scenario where `state.base_excess_as_quote = 100` and `burn_value = 99`.
2. In the `balanced` function:
   ```python
   left : uint256 = burn_value - state.base_excess_as_quote
   left = 99 - 100 = -1
   ```
3. This negative value is then used in further calculations:
   ```python
   quote: uint256 = left / 2
   ```
4. Due to the use of `uint256`, this will result in an extremely large value for `quote`, leading to incorrect token distribution.

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, ensure that `left` is never negative
