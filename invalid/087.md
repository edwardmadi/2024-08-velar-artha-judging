# User might be unable to close a position if the remaining interest and reserves are a dust amount.

## Summary
User might be unable to close a position if the remaining interest and reserves are a dust amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of `close`, `fees.UPDATE` is called.

```vyper
  value    : PositionValue = self.POSITIONS.close(position_id, ctx)
  base_amt : uint256       = self.MATH.eval(0, value.deltas.base_transfer)
  quote_amt: uint256       = self.MATH.eval(0, value.deltas.quote_transfer)
  self.POOLS.close(id, value.deltas)
  self.FEES.update(id)
```

The way the function works is that it fetches the previous fee terms, applies them for the time period since then and then calculates the new fee terms. The problem lies in the calculation of the new fee terms and precisely in the utilization calculation

```vyper
def dynamic_fees(pool: PoolState) -> DynFees:
    long_utilization : uint256 = self.utilization(pool.base_reserves, pool.base_interest)
    short_utilization: uint256 = self.utilization(pool.quote_reserves, pool.quote_interest)
```

```vyper
def utilization(reserves: uint256, interest: uint256) -> uint256:
    """
    Reserve utilization in percent (rounded down).
    """
    return 0 if (reserves == 0 or interest == 0) else (interest / (reserves / 100))
```

As we can see, the idea is to calculate a percentage. However, due to the division of `reserves / 100`, if `reserves < 100` , this would round down to 0 and then revert due to division by 0, which would ultimately not allow a user to close their position.

Furthermore, if the user has the only position on one's side (whether that be short or long), LP providers can abuse that to make his position impossible to close.

## Recommendation
Instead of calculating `(interest / (reserves / 100))`, better use `(interest * 100) / reserves`
