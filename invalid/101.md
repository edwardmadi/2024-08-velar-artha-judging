# Fee on transfer tokens not supported

## Summary

Some tokens like USDT used by the protocol take a transfer fee, but the [core::open](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L230) function does not properly account for fee-on-transfer tokens, leading to incorrect handling of the transferred amount. This can result in inaccurate collateral and fee calculations due to the contract assuming the full amount specified in the transferFrom operation is received.

## Vulnerability Detail

Fee-on-transfer tokens deduct a fee during the transfer, meaning the contract receives fewer tokens than the collateral0 amount specified in the transferFrom call. The current code calculates the protocol fee and collateral using the full collateral0 before the token transfer takes place, leading to inaccurate calculations when fee-on-transfer tokens are involved.

```vyper
cf         : Fee       = self.PARAMS.static_fees(collateral0)
fee        : uint256   = cf.fee
collateral : uint256   = cf.remaining

// some asserts...

if long: 
    assert ERC20(quote_token).transferFrom(user, self, collateral0), "ERR_ERC20"
else:
    assert ERC20(base_token).transferFrom(user, self, collateral0), "ERR_ERC20"
```

This calculation assumes that the entire collateral0 amount is transferred, but in the case of fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual received amount will be less.

## Impact

This could result in incorrect fee and collateral calculations, potentially causing the protocol to fail in future operations or incorrectly track token balances.

## Code Snippet

```vyper
cf         : Fee       = self.PARAMS.static_fees(collateral0)
fee        : uint256   = cf.fee
collateral : uint256   = cf.remaining

// some asserts...

if long: 
    assert ERC20(quote_token).transferFrom(user, self, collateral0), "ERR_ERC20"
else:
    assert ERC20(base_token).transferFrom(user, self, collateral0), "ERR_ERC20"
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, the protocol should calculate the actual transferred amount by subtracting the balance difference between the token contract before and after the transferFrom call. This ensures that the correct amount of tokens received is used for fee and collateral calculations.
