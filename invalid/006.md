# from_amount can revert if price 0.

## Summary
when asset price drop to zero then the from_amount gets reverted which prevents the user from closing any position.
## Vulnerability Detail

def from_amount(amount: uint256, price: uint256, one1: uint256) -> uint256:
  """
  Returns volume implied by price.
  """
 @>>  return (amount * one1) / price
## Impact
Long position should be automatically liquidated when their value drops to zero.The collateral of the position would typically be used to cover the losses.However due to revert caused by division by zero ,these long position will not be closed properly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
when closing the long position while price is zero,payout will be zero for user.donot call quote_to_base function to convert the final amount which will prevent division by zero.
or do a limit on price so that price cannot be zero.
