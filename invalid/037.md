# Users will incur unnecessary fees and potential losses due to inability to adjust collateral

### Summary

The lack of functionality to adjust collateral in open positions will cause unnecessary fees and potential losses for users as they will be forced to close and reopen positions to adjust collateral.



### Root Cause

In `gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy` the contract lacks functions to adjust collateral for open positions. The [`open`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L108-L152) and [`close`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L367-L390) functions are the only ways to manage position collateral.


```python
File: positions.vy
108: def open(
109:   user      : address,
110:   pool      : uint256,
111:   long      : bool,
112:   collateral: uint256,
113:   leverage  : uint256,
114:   ctx       : Ctx) -> PositionState:
115:   self._INTERNAL()
116: 
117:   # Opening a position with leverage can be thought of as purchasing
118:   # an amplified number of tokens.
119:   # Longs buy base tokens with quote collateral and shorts buy quote
120:   # tokens with base collateral (alternatively, longs buy base and shorts
121:   # sell base).
122:   virtual_tokens: uint256 = self.MATH.quote_to_base(collateral, ctx) if long else (
123:                             self.MATH.base_to_quote(collateral, ctx) )
124:   interest      : uint256 = virtual_tokens * leverage
125: 
126:   pos: PositionState      = PositionState({
127:     id         : self.next_position_id(),
128:     pool       : pool,
129:     user       : user,
130:     status     : Status.OPEN,
131:     long       : long,
132:     collateral : collateral,
133:     leverage   : leverage,
134:     interest   : interest,
135:     entry_price: ctx.price,
136:     exit_price : 0,
137:     opened_at  : block.number,
138:     closed_at  : 0,
139: 
140:     collateral_tagged: Tokens({base: 0, quote: collateral}) if long else (
141:                        Tokens({base: collateral, quote: 0}) ),
142:     interest_tagged  : Tokens({base: interest, quote: 0}) if long else (
143:                        Tokens({base: 0, quote: interest}) ),
144:   })
145:   ps: PoolState = self.POOLS.lookup(pool)
146: 
147:   assert Positions(self).get_nr_user_positions(user) <= MAX_POSITIONS
148:   assert self.PARAMS.is_legal_position(ps, pos)
149: 
150:   self.insert_user_position(user, pos.id)
151:   return self.insert(pos)

```



```python
File: positions.vy
367: def close(id: uint256, ctx: Ctx) -> PositionValue:
368:   self._INTERNAL()
369:   pos: PositionState = Positions(self).lookup(id)
370:   assert pos.status   == Status.OPEN  , ERR_PRECONDITIONS
371:   assert block.number  > pos.opened_at, ERR_PRECONDITIONS
372:   self.insert(PositionState({
373:     id         : pos.id,
374:     pool       : pos.pool,
375:     user       : pos.user,
376:     status     : Status.CLOSED,
377:     long       : pos.long,
378:     collateral : pos.collateral,
379:     leverage   : pos.leverage,
380:     interest   : pos.interest,
381:     entry_price: pos.entry_price,
382:     exit_price : ctx.price,
383:     opened_at  : pos.opened_at,
384:     closed_at  : block.number,
385: 
386:     collateral_tagged: pos.collateral_tagged,
387:     interest_tagged  : pos.interest_tagged,
388:   }))
389:   return Positions(self).value(id, ctx)
390: 

```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has an open position.
2. User wants to adjust the collateral of their open position (his position is near to be liquidatable).


### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User calls `open` function to create a position with initial collateral.
2. Market conditions change, his position is going to near liquidatable and the user wants to adjust his position's collateral.
3. User is forced to call the `close` function to close their position.
4. User calls `open` function again to create a new position with the desired collateral amount.


### Impact

The users cannot adjust the collateral of their open positions without closing them, which can lead to inefficiencies and potential losses due to the need to close and reopen positions.


### PoC

Alice opens a long position with 1000 USDT as collateral:

```python
# Alice opens a position
alice_position = positions.open(
    user=alice_address,
    pool=1,
    long=True,
    collateral=1000 * 10**6,  # 1000 USDT
    leverage=2,
    ctx=current_context
)
```

Market conditions change, and Alice wants to increase her collateral to 1500 USDT. However, there's no function to do this directly. Alice is forced to close her position and open a new one:

```python
# Alice closes her position
close_value = positions.close(alice_position.id, current_context)

# Alice opens a new position with increased collateral
new_alice_position = positions.open(
    user=alice_address,
    pool=1,
    long=True,
    collateral=1500 * 10**6,  # 1500 USDT
    leverage=2,
    ctx=current_context
)
```

In this process, Alice incurs additional transaction costs for closing and reopening the position. She may also suffer from price slippage if the market price changed between these transactions. There is also a possibility to liquidate.


### Mitigation

Introduce functions to adjust the collateral of an open position without closing it. This can be done by adding `increaseCollateral` and `decreaseCollateral` functions.
