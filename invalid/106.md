# LP tokens can be burnt without total supply being reduced

## Summary 
LP tokens can be burnt without total supply being reduced  

## Vulnerability Detail and Impact 

In concept of normal ERC20 tokens, we all know that sending tokens to address(0) is considered  a burning mechansim/implementation and there are many reasons protocols will want to burn tokens such as supply control etc. and from the contest readMe the project will integrate with normal ERC20 tokens so it is expected to assume that the LP token should operate normally.
But in `ERC20plus.vy` there is no implementation that reduces supply when tokens are sent to the zero address all transfers are treated the same way and this is not supposed to be so. So in cases when the protcol wants to burn token and sends to address(0) or a user sends tokens to address(0), other LP providers will expect the LP tokens to have a reduced supply but those tokens are still counted as total supply and used to influence pay out amounts when minting and burning.

## Tool Used 
Manual Review 

## Recommendation
Change total supply when tokens are transferred to address(0) or do not allow transfers to addr(0)
