# Liquidity providers will not receive any outstanding fees for positions they backed

### Summary

When a liquidity provider leaves the pool by calling [`burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L104-L128) the core contract calls [`calc_burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L213-L223) to calculate the amount of base and quote token to distribute. This function does not consider outstanding fees. Therefore the existing LP does receive less tokens as he should.

### Root Cause

In [`calc_burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L213-L223) the contract uses [`total_reserves`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L119-L121) as the total pool value. But this does not consider outstanding fees that will only be paid when the user position is closed or liquidated. This is arguably not fair to the LP that is leaving. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. open positions with outstanding fees

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

The existing LP will get less tokens as he should. The amount he loses out on is based on the amount of outstanding fees in open positions and his ratio compared to the remaining pool. If there are 0.1 ETH outstanding fees, and he owns 10% of the pool, he loses 0.01 ETH profit.

### PoC

## Walkthrough

LP1 and LP2 mint their positions:
```vyper
    mint(VEL, STX, LP, d(10_000), d(50_000), price=d(5), sender=lp_provider)
    mint(VEL, STX, LP, d(10_000), d(50_000), price=d(5), sender=lp_provider2)
```

A user opens a position:
```vyper
    tx = open(VEL, STX, True, d(999), 10, price=d(5), sender=long)
```

After 10 weeks some fees accumulated. At that time the LP2 burns his LP tokens:
```vyper
    lp_amount_lp2 = LP.balanceOf(lp_provider2)
    burn(VEL, STX, LP, lp_amount_lp2, price=d(5), sender=lp_provider2)
```

Afterwards the user closes his position:
```vyper
    tx = close(VEL, STX, 1, price=d(5), sender=long)
```

And now also the LP1 burns his LP tokens:
```vyper
    lp_amount_lp1 = LP.balanceOf(lp_provider)
    burn(VEL, STX, LP, lp_amount_lp1, price=d(5), sender=lp_provider)
```

Calculating the profit of LP1 and LP2, one would assume that both should have the same profit. They both backed the user position for the same time (LP2 for a few blocks less at most). Therefor it is asserted that:
```vyper
    assert lp1_profit == lp2_profit
```

This test will fail, as the profits are not distributed fairly. It reverts with:
```text
    FAILED tests/test_positions.py::test_burn_fees - assert 41 == 0
```

One can see that LP1 earned all the fees paid by the user and LP2 got none.

### Mitigation

The contract `pools.vy` should call the `fees.vy` contract and look up the currently outstanding fees inside of the [`total_reserves`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/pools.vy#L119-L121) function.
