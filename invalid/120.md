# Inability to Liquidate Positions When User Contract Deactivates Token Receiving

### Summary

If a user has created a smart contract that is designed to reject or revert token transfers, the liquidate function within the protocol will continuously revert when attempting to transfer any fees to the user. This causes the liquidation process to fail, leaving the unliquidated until `base_amt_final.remaining` and ` quote_amt_final.remaining` are 0. This situation can create a significant issue, especially in scenarios where liquidation is necessary to maintain the solvency and proper functioning of the protocol as withholding open positions might deny people from opening/closing positions or burning lp_tokens.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L338
The root cause of this issue lies in the assumption that all users are externally owned accounts (EOAs) or contracts that will accept token transfers. When a user deploys a smart contract that intentionally rejects token transfers, the liquidation function is unable to complete successfully, as it attempts to transfer liquidation fees proceeds to the user. If the user’s contract reverts during this transfer, the entire liquidation process fails.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.The user has a position that is eligible for liquidation.
2.The protocol's liquidate function calculates the liquidation amounts (base_amt_final and quote_amt_final) and attempts to transfer these amounts to the user and liquidator.
3.The user’s address is a smart contract that contains logic to revert or reject incoming token transfers.

### External pre-conditions

1.The user has deployed a smart contract that deactivates receiving tokens, either by rejecting transfers outright or by including conditions that cause the transfer function to revert.


### Attack Path

1. Deploy a Malicious Contract: The user deploys a smart contract designed to reject token transfers (e.g., by reverting any ERC20.transfer calls).
2. Open a Position: The user opens a position on the protocol that eventually becomes eligible for liquidation.
3. Trigger Liquidation: Once the position becomes eligible,  liquidators  attempts to liquidate the position by calling the liquidate function to receive their share of the fee.
Liquidation Reversion: During the liquidation process, when the protocol attempts to transfer the liquidated funds (e.g., base_amt_final.remaining and quote_amt_final.remaining) to the user’s contract, the transfer fails because the user’s contract rejects the tokens.
Continuous Reversion: The liquidate function reverts continuously due to the failure in transferring the tokens, causing the liquidation process to be incomplete. This can persist until the position's collateral is depleted or the protocol manually intervenes.

### Impact

1. Failure to Liquidate: The protocol is unable to liquidate positions of users who deploy contracts that reject token transfers, leading to potential under-collateralized positions remaining open.
2. Protocol Risk: If the liquidation process fails for multiple users, it could lead to an accumulation of bad debt within the protocol, undermining the financial stability of the system.
3. Liquidation Inconsistency: The protocol's liquidation process becomes inconsistent and unreliable, potentially leading to a loss of trust among users and liquidators.
4.Denial of Service: The inability to complete the liquidation process can be exploited as a denial-of-service attack on the protocol, particularly if many users adopt similar contracts.

### PoC

1. Deploy a contract `RejectingContract` that can activate/deactivate receiving tokens
2. The user opens a position on the protocol using the `RejectingContract` address as their user address.
3. Let the position become eligible for liquidation due to market movements or fees.
4. A liquidator or the protocol itself calls the liquidate function.
The transfer to the RejectingContract fails, causing the liquidate function to revert, demonstrating the issue.

### Mitigation

1.Create a mapping that records the amount of tokens owed to each user due to failed transfers. This ensures that the user's funds are safe and can be withdrawn later.
2. Modify the `liquidate` function to track any failed transfers to the user's contract due to the inability to receive tokens. Instead of reverting the entire transaction, update an internal ledger within the protocol to reflect the amount owed to the user.
3. Implement a new function that allows users to withdraw their funds from the protocol whenever they choose, using the balances_owed mapping to determine the amount they are entitled to.
