# The `api.burn` function should have cool down period

### Summary

Liquidity providers can burn their liquidity tokens anytime regardless minting time.
Attackers can take fees without contributing to the pool using this vulnerability.

### Root Cause

There is no cool down period in the [`api.burn`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L104-L128) function.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Bob(lp) mints 100 `lp_token` by depositing 100 in quote token and the total supply of `lp_token` is 100.
2. Alice opens the long position.
3. The following steps are performed in one transaction:
    - Alice mints 1000 `lp_token` by depositing 1000
    - Alice closes the long position: she has to pay 10 fees to the pool and the pool's total reserve is `1000 + 100 + 10 = 1110`.
    - Alice burns 1000 `lp_token`: Alice receives `1000 * 1110 / 1100 = 1009`

Alice pays 10 fees while closing the position and receives additional 9 fees while burning.
Even though Alice's minted 1000 `lp_token` did not contribute to the users' positions, she received fees and this is unfair for other liquidity providers.

This vulnerability is available for attackers to frontrun the closing position.

### Impact

Fees are distributed to liquidity providers unfairly.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add the cool down period in the `api.burn` function and make burning available after cool down period.
