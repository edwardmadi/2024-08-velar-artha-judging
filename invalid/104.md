# Lp amount will be minted lower than what it really expected in mint function

### Summary

LPs may receive fewer tokens than expected when minting due to fluctuating pool reserves. Without specifying a minimum LP amount, this can lead to unexpected fund losses for LPs. Adding a min_lp_amount parameter to the Api::mint function can prevent this issue


### Internal pre-conditions
Consider change config in tests/conftest.py
I do it for better understanding,Fee doesn't important in this issue
```python
PARAMS = {
  'MIN_FEE'               : 0,
  'MAX_FEE'               : 0,

  'PROTOCOL_FEE'          :1000
    ...
}
```

### Impact

Lp amount will be minted lower than what it really expected

### PoC
**Textual PoC:**
we assume protocol fee is zero in this example
1-Alice opens long position when price is $2
2-Joe opens a short position when price is $2
3-Price goes down to $1
4-Bob calls `Pools::calc_mint` and he realize if he provide 1000 VEL to pool,he gets 1000 LP
5-Bob send his tx to network
6-liquidator bot liquids Alice's position
7-Bob's tx will be executed and Bob get 952 lp instead of 1000
8-Joe closes his position and gets his profit,hence pool's reserve will be deducted
9-Bob burns his LPs token,and he gets 772 VEL instead of 1000 VEL
**Coded PoC:**
Place below test in `tests/test_positions.py` and run `pytest -k test_get_less_lp_amt_than_expected - s`
```python
def test_get_less_lp_amt_than_expected(setup, VEL, STX, lp_provider, LP, pools, open, long, close, burn, liquidator, liquidate, mint, short):
    setup()
    #Alice opens position
    open(VEL, STX, True, d(1000), 5, price=d(2), sender=long)
    #Joe opens short position
    open(VEL, STX, False, d(1000), 5, price=d(2), sender=short)

    #Bob calls calc_mint 
    assert pools.calc_mint(1, d(1000), 0, d(20_000), ctx(d(1))) == d(1000)

    #Alice will be liquidated
    liquidate(VEL, STX, 1, price = d(1), sender = liquidator)

    #Bob's tx will be executed
    mint(VEL, STX, LP, d(1000), 0, price=d(1), sender=lp_provider)    

    assert LP.totalSupply() == 20952426306#its mean,Bob get 48 lp token lower than expected

    #Joe closes his position
    close(VEL, STX, 2, price=d(1), sender=short)


    vel_bef = VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider)
    #Bob burn his lp tokens
    burn(VEL, STX, LP, 952426306, price=d(1), sender=lp_provider)
    
    vel_after = VEL.balanceOf(lp_provider)

    print("vel_diff:", (vel_after - vel_bef) / 1e6)#Bob lost $228 
```


### Mitigation

`Api::mint` should have another parameter like min_lp_amount which can be checked when the lp token wants to be mint
