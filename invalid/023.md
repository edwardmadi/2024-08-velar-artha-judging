# Improper Comparison with self Across Multiple Files

## Summary

During the audit of the `core.vy` contract, a significant security vulnerability was identified. The vulnerability arises from the improper comparison of `msg.sender` with `self`. This incorrect practice undermines access control mechanisms within the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `core.vy` contract, there are instances where functions compare `msg.sender` to `self` to check permissions. This comparison is flawed since `self` refers to the contract instance, and `msg.sender` represents the address of the entity invoking the function. These two entities are inherently different and the comparison will always fail, causing the function to be unusable.

## Impact

1. **Functionality Blockage**: Functions relying on this failed comparison will be rendered unusable since the check always fails. This inhibits significant features of the contract.

2. **Security Risk**: Incorrect access control reduces the contract's intended security boundaries, possibly leading to unauthorized access or restricted execution of essential functions.

3. **Potential Exploitation**: Misuse of access control could lead to unintended financial exposures or disruptions in the contract's service.

## Code Snippet

**Incorrect Comparison in `core.vy`**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L114-L116
```python
@internal
def _INTERNAL():
    assert (msg.sender == self.CORE or msg.sender == self), "ERR_PERMISSIONS"
```

This ensures that the comparison is done with authorized addresses instead of the contract instance.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. **Fix the Access Control Check**:
    - The proper check should verify `msg.sender` against an authorized address such as `self.DEPLOYER`. This ensures only the deployer or a designated core contract can invoke the function.

2. **Corrected Code in `core.vy`**:

```python
@internal
def _safe_internal():
    assert (msg.sender == self.DEPLOYER or msg.sender == self.CORE), "ERR_PERMISSIONS"
```

3. **Apply the Correct Check Consistently**:
    - Ensure this updated comparison is used in place of `msg.sender == self` in all internal authorization checks within `core.vy`.
