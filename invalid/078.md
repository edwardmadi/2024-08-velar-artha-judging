# Improper calculation of utilization ratio

## Summary
Utilization ratio calculation is executed in improper way that might lead to DoS.

## Vulnerability Detail
```vyper
def utilization(reserves: uint256, interest: uint256) -> uint256:
    """
    Reserve utilization in percent (rounded down).
    """
    return 0 if (reserves == 0 or interest == 0) else (interest / (reserves / 100))
```

Here's the code snippet of `utilization` function that calculates utilization ration based on `interest` and `reserves` and returns as percentage between 0 and 100.

As shown in the code snippet, it calculates `reserves / 100` first and then divides the `interest`.
This means that the transaction reverts when `reserves` is between 1 and 99 because of division by zero.

The `utilization` function is called whenever there's an action in the protocol, e.g. opening and closing positions.
So as a result, when `reserves` is less than 100, the protocol does not work until someone adds LP to the pool, even though this can be rare cases in usual.

## Impact
DoS of protocol because if incorrect calculation.
Another impact is the description says it does rounding down, but it will round-up in some cases.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The calculation should be modified as follows:

```diff
def utilization(reserves: uint256, interest: uint256) -> uint256:
    """
    Reserve utilization in percent (rounded down).
    """
-   return 0 if (reserves == 0 or interest == 0) else (interest / (reserves / 100))
+   return 0 if (reserves == 0 or interest == 0) else (interest * 100 / reserves)
```
