# Users can open position with leverage as 0

### Summary

Users deposit collateral tokens to open long or short positions with leverage. However, they can open position with leverage as `0`. As a result, they can earn funding fees regardless of price fluctuation.

### Root Cause

In the [`core.open](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L230-L268) function, there is no check if leverage is `0` or not.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is BTC/USDT (base/quote) pool.
2. There are many opposite positions in the pool.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice opens the long position with leverage 0.
2. After some time, Alice closes the position by paying borrowing fees to the protocol and receives imbalance funding fees.
If imbalance funding fee is greater than borrowing fees, she earned without contributing to the pool.

### Impact

Users can earn funding fees regardless of price fluctuation by setting leverage as `0`.

### PoC

In the [core.open](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L230-L268) function, there is no check if leverage is `0` or not.
If `leverage = 0`, `interest = 0` from L124.
```vyper
File: gl-sherlock\contracts\positions.vy
124:   interest      : uint256 = virtual_tokens * leverage
```
Then, `profit` and `loss`  are `0` because `pos.interest = 0`.
```vyper
File: contracts\positions.vy
288:   vtokens: uint256       = pos.interest 
289:   val0   : uint256       = self.MATH.base_to_quote(vtokens, ctx0) 
290:   val1   : uint256       = self.MATH.base_to_quote(vtokens, ctx)  
291:   loss   : uint256       = val0 - val1 if val0 > val1 else 0      
292:   profit : uint256       = val1 - val0 if val1 > val0 else 0      
```
As a result, if imbalance funding fee is bigger than borrowing fee, user can take profit regardless of price fluctuations.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to check leverage is zero or not in the [core.open](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L230-L268) function.
