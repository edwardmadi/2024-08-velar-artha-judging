# Actual funding can be lower than intended due to precision loss in `utilization`

### Summary

Because `params#utilization` is not multiplied by a precision factor, computed utilization can be up to 100% lower than the actual one (i.e. 0 instead of ~1), which in turn would make funding fees up to 100% lower than intended.

### Root Cause

Absense of precision factor in `params#utilization` (and absence of division by the same factor in `params#scale`). 

### Impact

Shorts/longs receive up to 100% less funding fees from longs/shorts than they should.

### PoC

base_reserves = 101e18
base_interest = 1e18
utilization = 1e18 / (101e18 / 100) = 1e18 / 1.01e18 = 0

### Mitigation

`utilization` should be multiplied by 1e18 (or another suitable precision factor).
`scale` should be divided by the same value.
