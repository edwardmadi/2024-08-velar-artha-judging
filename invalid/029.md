# If a position makes more profit than leverage rate, the position is locked

### Summary

When a position is doing great and making more profit than the interest, the position is locked and cannot be closed.

### Root Cause

When a position is closed, it's delta is calculated and passed to pool for a reserve update:

```vyper
  value    : PositionValue = self.POSITIONS.close(position_id, ctx)
  base_amt : uint256       = self.MATH.eval(0, value.deltas.base_transfer)
  quote_amt: uint256       = self.MATH.eval(0, value.deltas.quote_transfer)
  self.POOLS.close(id, value.deltas)
```

And the internal function `positions::value` is called to calculate the position's current value:

```vyper
@external
def close(id: uint256, ctx: Ctx) -> PositionValue:
  self._INTERNAL()
  pos: PositionState = Positions(self).lookup(id)
  assert pos.status   == Status.OPEN  , ERR_PRECONDITIONS
  assert block.number  > pos.opened_at, ERR_PRECONDITIONS
  self.insert(PositionState({
    id         : pos.id,
    pool       : pos.pool,
    user       : pos.user,
    status     : Status.CLOSED,
    long       : pos.long,
    collateral : pos.collateral,
    leverage   : pos.leverage,
    interest   : pos.interest,
    entry_price: pos.entry_price,
    exit_price : ctx.price,
    opened_at  : pos.opened_at,
    closed_at  : block.number,

    collateral_tagged: pos.collateral_tagged,
    interest_tagged  : pos.interest_tagged,
  }))
  return Positions(self).value(id, ctx)
```

Eventually, [`positions::calc_pnl`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L283) is called, taking a long position as example, it calculates the value difference since the open time and the current time to find out loss or profit:

```vyper
@external
@view
def calc_pnl_long(id: uint256, ctx: Ctx, remaining: uint256) -> PnL:
  pos    : PositionState = Positions(self).lookup(id)
  ctx0   : Ctx           = Ctx({price         : pos.entry_price,
                                base_decimals : ctx.base_decimals,
                                quote_decimals: ctx.quote_decimals})
  vtokens: uint256       = pos.interest
  val0   : uint256       = self.MATH.base_to_quote(vtokens, ctx0)
  val1   : uint256       = self.MATH.base_to_quote(vtokens, ctx)
  loss   : uint256       = val0 - val1 if val0 > val1 else 0
  profit : uint256       = val1 - val0 if val1 > val0 else 0
  # Positions whose collateral drops to zero due to fee obligations
  # are liquidated and don't receive a payout.
  final  : uint256       = 0 if remaining == 0 else (
                             0 if loss > remaining else (
                               remaining - loss if loss > 0 else (
                               remaining + profit ) ) )
  # Accounting in quote, payout in base.
  payout : uint256       = self.MATH.quote_to_base(final, ctx)
  assert payout <= pos.interest, ERR_INVARIANTS
  return PnL({
    loss     : loss,
    profit   : profit,
    # Used to determine liquidatability.
    # Could use final instead to account for positive pnl,
    # which would allow positions in profit to be kept open longer
    # but this lets us bound position lifetimes (which lets LPs estimate how
    # long reserves will be locked) and unless fees are very high shouldn't
    # make too much of a difference for users.
    remaining: final - profit if final > profit else final,
    payout   : payout,
  })
```

The calculation is essentially converting base token to quote token by normalizing decimals and multiple by prices, which is fetched when `ctx` is created. For the same amount of quote tokens which position own initially bought in for base token, if the new price rises, position owner would gain profits by closing the position. The profit is basically `base_amount * (price_now - price_open)`. Near the end of the function, we see there is an assertion clause, which requires the payout, which is `remaining + profit` to be less than `interest`, which is `base_amount * leverage`. When the profit exceeds this value, it would trigger a revert, to stop the close operation, and in this case, a position can never be closed, and will be locked.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Initially Alice opens a long position to buy 1000 base token with 2000 quote tokens and leverage rate of 100%(1). Assume the price is 1 base = 2 quote, so this makes the position interest to be 1000, as 2000 quote = 1000 base, which implies the virtual token is 1000 base as well. So interest = virtual * leverage = 1000 * 1 = 2000.
2. After a while, the price of base rises, makes 1 base = 2.2 quote, so this Alice's position actually worth 2200 quote tokens, and let's suppose that Alice's position still has 1900 worth of quote remaining, this makes her position's payout to be 2200 - 2000 + 1900 = 2100, but as 2100 > 2000, which is the interest, her close operation will be denied.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User's position can be locked for indefinite amount of time, until remaining is further deducted or the price drops. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an option to users to claim at max of `interest` amount of payout and close the position.
