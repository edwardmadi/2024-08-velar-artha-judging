# Attackers can create positions that have no incentives to be liquidated

### Summary

There is no incentives to liquidate tiny positions, which may lead to insolvency.

### Root Cause

In the [core.open](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L230-L268) function, there is no minimum amount to open a new position.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is BTC/USDT (base/quote) pool.

### External pre-conditions

Attacker should be well-funded(e.g. a competing perp dex).

### Attack Path

An attacker opens lots of positions with low collateral.

### Impact

Lots of small losses are equivalent to one large loss, which will lead to bad debt that the exchange will have to cover in order to allow others to withdraw from the PnL pool.

### PoC

There is no minimum position size and an attacker can open lots of positions with low collateral.
As all calculations happen at close time, closing position costs much more gas than opening the position.

### Mitigation

Have a minimum total open notional for positions, to ensure there's a large enough fee to overcome liquidation gas costs.
