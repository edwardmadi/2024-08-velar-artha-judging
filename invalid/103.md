# Wrong decimal conversion when checking slippage in oracle.vy

## Summary
Wrong decimal conversion when checking slippage in `oracle.vy`

## Vulnerability Detail
In `oracle.vy`, the price used to compare to the slippage here https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy#L122-L124  is gotten from the oracle (actual price) while the desired price argument is user provided.
The issue is that the decimal of price gotten from the oracle is converted to ensure same precision with the protocol https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy#L89-L102  , but the price obtained from the user is not converted to match the same precision with what the current price gives hence when there is a decimal difference `oracle.check_slippage()` will always revert.
This ultimately blocks all protocol functions as all protocol functions require users to put in slippage and desired price.
And this is not a user mistake as 
1) It will affect all users.     2) Users are expected to just  provide price not do any decimal conversion 

## Impact 
Serious DOS of all protcol functions 

## Tools Used
Manual Review 

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Convert the user provided price to the same precision as the one gotten from the oracle
