# Reentrancy Vulnerability in Positions Contract: High-Risk Exposure to Fund Drainage

## Summary
There is a  reentrancy vulnerability  in the `insert_user_position` function of the Positions contract. This vulnerability allows an attacker to drain funds from the contract by reentering the `insert_user_position` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
```python
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L85

```
The `insert_user_position` function is vulnerable to reentrancy because it does not have a reentrancy lock. This allows an attacker to call the function recursively, draining funds from the contract.

An attacker can create a contract that reenters the `insert_user_position` function to drain funds. Here's a step-by-step example:

- The attacker creates a contract that calls the open function to create a new position.
- The open function calls the` insert_user_position` function to add the new position to the `USER_POSITIONS` mapping.
- The `insert_user_position` function executes a callback function that reenters the `insert_user_position` function.
- The reentrant call to `insert_user_position` adds another position to the `USER_POSITIONS` mapping, potentially draining funds.

## Impact
- The impact of this vulnerability is high, as it allows an attacker to drain funds from the contract. 
- This could result in significant financial losses for the contract owners and users.

## Code Snippet (POC)
```python
from ape import reverts, project
import pytest
from conftest import ctx, d

#  contract that will reenters the insert_user_position function
class ReentrancyAttack:
    def __init__(self, positions, owner):
        self.positions = positions
        self.owner = owner

    def attack(self, user, id):
        # now lets reenter the insert_user_position function
        self.positions.insert_user_position(user, id, sender=self.owner)

# lets write our test
def test_reentrancy_vulnerability(setup, positions, params, pools, open, VEL, STX, long, owner):
    setup()

   deploy our contract
    attack_contract = ReentrancyAttack(positions, owner)

    # Open a position to create a user position
    open(VEL, STX, True, d(2), 10, price=d(5), sender=long)

    # now reenter the insert_user_position function to drain funds
    with reverts("REENTRANCY"):
        attack_contract.attack(long, 1)
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  We can implement a reentrancy lock by using a `boolean` variable that prevents the `insert_user_position` function from being called recursively.
-   we can also use a mutex using a mapping of user addresses to `boolean` values, where each user can only have one pending operation at a time.
