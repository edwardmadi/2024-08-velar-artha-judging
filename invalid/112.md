# When there is no opposite position, imbalance funding fees are locked in the pool forever

### Summary

When users close the position, they pay imbalance funding fees to the opposite position.
If there is no opposite position, no one can receive these fees and they are locked in the pool forever.

### Root Cause

In [`fees.vy:186`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/fees.vy#L186), if `fs.short_collateral = 0`, `received_short_term` is set as zero.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is some base and quote token reserves in the pool.
2. There is no short position in the pool.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Alice opens a long position.
2. After some time, Alice closes the position before someone opens a short position.

Here, Alice pays imbalance funding fees.
But as there is no short positions to receive the imbalance funding fees and fees are locked to the pool's `quote_collateral`.

### Impact

Some imbalance funding fees are locked in the pool forever.

### PoC

In the `params.dynamic_fees` function, `funding_long` is calculated using `long_utilization` and `short_utilization` from [L47](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/params.vy#L46).

```vyper
46:     funding_long     : uint256 = self.funding_fee(
47:       borrowing_long, long_utilization,  short_utilization)
```

As there is no short position, and `long_utilization > 0, short_utilization = 0`.
Thus, Alice should pay imbalance funding fees(`paid_long_term`) to short position from [L185](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/fees.vy#L185).

```vyper
185:   paid_long_term      : uint256 = self.apply(fs.long_collateral, fs.funding_long * new_terms)
186:   received_short_term : uint256 = self.divide(paid_long_term,    fs.short_collateral)
```

As `fs.short_collateral = 0`, `received_short_term = 0` from L186.
When Alice closes the position, `fees.funding_paid` is subtracted from Alice's quote collateral and added to pool's `quote_collateral` value from [L211](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/positions.vy#L208-L212).

```vyper
209:     quote_reserves  : [self.MATH.PLUS(pos.collateral),
210:                        self.MATH.MINUS(fees.funding_paid)],
211:     quote_collateral: [self.MATH.PLUS(fees.funding_paid),
212:                        self.MATH.MINUS(pos.collateral)],
[...]
223:     quote_transfer  : [self.MATH.PLUS(pnl.payout),
224:                        self.MATH.PLUS(fees.funding_received)],
225:     quote_reserves  : [self.MATH.MINUS(pnl.payout)],
226:     quote_collateral: [self.MATH.MINUS(fees.funding_received)],
```

But, no one can take these fees from L224 and they are locked in the pool forever.

### Mitigation

Add the mechanism to manage the locked fees.
