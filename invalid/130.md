# Inability to Close Position Due to Lack of Reserves Could Lead to Unfair Losses or Missed Profits

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L272
If a user is unable to close their position due to insufficient reserves in the protocol( by design), they currently have no guaranteed mechanism to remove their position at the desired price once the reserves are replenished. This lack of functionality can lead to unfair outcomes where the user's position could become profitable, but they are still charged ongoing borrowing and funding fees until they can close the position, potentially resulting in significant financial losses or missed profits.



### Root Cause

The protocol does not provide a mechanism for users to lock in the desired closing price of their position when attempting to close it in conditions where the protocol lacks sufficient reserves. Consequently, users are forced to keep their positions open and continue paying borrowing and funding fees until they can close the position, which may not happen until after market conditions have changed, potentially eliminating any potential profit.



### Internal pre-conditions

1.The user has an open position that they wish to close.
2.The protocol's reserves are insufficient to cover the payout required for closing the position.
3.The protocol attempts to close the position but fails due to a lack of reserves.

### External pre-conditions

1.The market conditions make the user's position potentially profitable, or the user wants to close the position to stop paying borrowing and funding fees.
2.There is a lack of sufficient liquidity or reserves in the protocol to settle the user's payo

### Attack Path

1.Open a Position:

 - A user opens a leveraged position on an asset with the expectation of closing it at a future time when it becomes profitable or meets certain risk criteria.
2. Attempt to Close Position When Reserves Are Low:

- The user tries to close the position when they believe it is profitable or to stop further fee accumulation.
- However, the protocol's reserves are insufficient to cover the payout required to close the position.

3.Forced to Keep Position Open:

- The protocol does not provide a mechanism for the user to lock in the price at which they attempted to close the position or to guarantee closure once reserves are available.
- The user is forced to keep the position open, continuing to accrue borrowing and funding fees.
4.Missed Profit or Losses Accrue:

- By the time reserves are available, the market conditions may have changed such that the userâ€™s position is no longer profitable or has accrued additional losses due to ongoing fees.


### Impact

Users may miss out on potential profits and even worse an suffer unfair losses due to the inability to close their positions at the desired price when reserves are temporarily insufficient.
Users are exposed to a higher risk of liquidation as they cannot close their positions to manage risk when desired, leading to potential liquidation at less favorable prices.
Such scenarios will push Users to lose trust in the protocol if they feel that they cannot close their positions fairly or in a timely manner due to reserve limitations. Users are exposed to a higher risk of liquidation as they cannot close their positions to manage risk when desired, leading to potential liquidation at less favorable prices.


### PoC

Assume a user opens a leveraged long position with 100 USDT collateral at a BTC price of 50,000 USDT.
The BTC price rises to 55,000 USDT, and the user attempts to close the position to lock in the profit.
However, the protocol's reserves are insufficient to cover the payout required for the user's position closure.
The user cannot close the position and must keep it open while continuing to pay borrowing and funding fees.
Over time, eitehr the BTC price returns to 50,000 USDT, or lower, and the user's position becomes unprofitable or the borrowing fees and funding fees became greater than the collateral.
The user misses out on the opportunity to lock in the profit at 55,000 USDT and incurs further losses due to ongoing fees, potentially leading to an unwanted liquidation.

### Mitigation

Allow users to lock in the price at which they attempt to close their position when the protocol lacks sufficient reserves. Once reserves are replenished, the position can be closed at the locked-in price, ensuring fair treatment.
