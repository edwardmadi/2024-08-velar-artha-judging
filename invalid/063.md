# Lack of Enforcement of Token-Specific Deviation Thresholds in Slippage Check

### Summary

The current implementation of the `price` function in the oracle contract allows user-provided slippage values without enforcing token-specific deviation thresholds. This can lead to incorrect pricing in various operations, potentially causing financial losses for users or the protocol itself.


### Root Cause

In [`gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy`, the `check_slippage` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy#L120-L124) uses the `slippage` value provided by the user when calling the [`price` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy#L57-L77) through other function. The protocol does not enforce token-specific deviation thresholds, which can lead to issues:

```python
File: oracle.vy
120: @internal
121: @pure
122: def check_slippage(current: uint256, desired: uint256, slippage: uint256) -> bool:
123:   if current > desired: return (current - desired) <= slippage
124:   else                : return (desired - current) <= slippage

```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol supports multiple tokens with different deviation thresholds (e.g., BTC/USD and ETH/USD with 0.5%, USDC/USD and USDT/USD with 0.2%).
2. The `slippage` parameter in the `price` function is set by the user and may be higher than some tokens' deviation thresholds.

### External pre-conditions

1. The price of a token with a lower deviation threshold (e.g., USDC, USDT) changes by an amount greater than its threshold but less than the user-provided slippage value.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker observes that the protocol does not enforce token-specific deviation thresholds.
2. The attacker waits for or observes the price of a token with a lower deviation threshold (e.g., USDC) to change by an amount greater than its threshold but less than the user-provided slippage value.
3. The attacker calls a function that uses the `CONTEXT` function in `api.vy`, which in turn calls the `price` function in the oracle contract with the observed price:

```python
File: api.vy
52: @internal
53: def CONTEXT(
54:     base_token : address,
55:     quote_token: address,
56:     desired    : uint256,
57:     slippage   : uint256,
58:     payload    : Bytes[224]
59: ) -> Ctx:
60:   base_decimals : uint256 = convert(ERC20Plus(base_token).decimals(), uint256)
61:   quote_decimals: uint256 = convert(ERC20Plus(quote_token).decimals(), uint256)
62:   # this will revert on error
63:   price         : uint256 = self.ORACLE.price(quote_decimals,
64:                                               desired,
65:                                               slippage,
66:                                               payload)
67:   return Ctx({
68:     price         : price,
69:     base_decimals : base_decimals,
70:     quote_decimals: quote_decimals,
71:   })

```

4. The [`check_slippage` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy#L120-L124) in the oracle contract allows the price to pass:

```python:gl-sherlock/contracts/oracle.vy
File: oracle.vy
120: @internal
121: @pure
122: def check_slippage(current: uint256, desired: uint256, slippage: uint256) -> bool:
123:   if current > desired: return (current - desired) <= slippage
124:   else                : return (desired - current) <= slippage

```

5. The price is accepted and used in the protocol, potentially affecting various operations like minting, burning, opening positions, etc.


### Impact

The protocol suffers from potential price discrepancies for tokens with lower deviation thresholds. This can lead to incorrect pricing in various operations, potentially causing financial losses for users or the protocol itself. 


### PoC

1. Assume a user provides a slippage value of 0.5% for all tokens.
2. USDC has a deviation threshold of 0.2% according to the Redstone oracle.
3. The current USDC price is $1.00.
4. The USDC price changes to $1.004 (0.4% change) due to market conditions.
5. A function (e.g., `mint`) in `api.vy` that uses the `CONTEXT` function is called:

```python
self.CONTEXT(base_token, quote_token, 1004000, 5000, payload)
```

6. The `price` function in `oracle.vy` is called with these parameters:

```python
self.ORACLE.price(quote_decimals, 1004000, 5000, payload)
```

7. The `check_slippage` function allows this price:

```python
File: oracle.vy
120: @internal
121: @pure
122: def check_slippage(current: uint256, desired: uint256, slippage: uint256) -> bool:
123:   if current > desired: return (current - desired) <= slippage
124:   else                : return (desired - current) <= slippage

```

8. The price is accepted and used in the protocol, potentially affecting various operations.


### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, implement token-specific deviation thresholds in the oracle contract. This can be done by maintaining a mapping of tokens to their respective deviation thresholds and using these thresholds in the `check_slippage` function.
