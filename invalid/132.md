# Delayed Liquidations Can Result in Larger Losses and Potential Dos for other parts of the protocol

### Summary

Liquidations in the protocol are performed by external parties (liquidators) who call the liquidate function. These liquidators are incentivized by receiving a portion of the collateral from liquidated positions. However, during periods of high network congestion, gas prices can increase significantly, and if the cost to perform a liquidation exceeds the potential reward, liquidators may delay or avoid liquidations altogether, even for liquidation bots it might become unprofitable to call the liquidate function(if a user has a gas-intensive receive function in their contract, it can significantly increase the cost of executing a liquidation). This delay allows positions that should be liquidated to remain open, accruing additional losses and potentially leading to bad debt for the protocol. Moreover, as long as these positions remain open, they occupy reserves that block liquidity providers (LPs) from burning their LP tokens or other users from opening/closing other positions.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L308
The root cause of this issue is the reliance on external liquidators to perform liquidations in the protocol. When gas fees are high, liquidators may choose not to execute the liquidate function if the potential reward does not cover the transaction costs, resulting in delayed liquidations or loss of money for the protocol in case of use of liquidation bots(if a user has a gas-intensive receive function in their contract, it can significantly increase the cost of executing a liquidation and might drain the liquidation bot). Meanwhile, positions that should be liquidated remain open, accumulating further losses and holding protocol reserves hostage.



### Internal pre-conditions

-The protocol relies on external liquidators to identify and execute liquidations.
-The liquidate function requires a gas fee that may vary depending on network congestion.


### External pre-conditions

-The network experiences periods of high congestion, causing gas prices to spike.
-Liquidators are rational actors who consider gas costs versus rewards before performing liquidations.
- The position in question is eligible for liquidation based on the protocol’s rules (e.g., under-collateralized, significant losses).

### Attack Path

- During periods of high network congestion, gas prices increase significantly.
- Liquidators analyze the cost of executing the liquidate function versus the potential rewards (a portion of the liquidated collateral). If the gas costs are higher than the rewards, they choose not to perform the liquidation.
- As a result, the liquidation is delayed or not executed at all. (if executed by liquidation bot, protocol will lose fees) Positions that should be liquidated remain open, accruing additional borrowing and funding fees, leading to more losses for the protocol.


### Impact

Open positions with excessive gas costs hold onto the protocol’s reserves, preventing liquidity providers from burning their LP tokens or other users from opening new positions.
The protocol’s efficiency is reduced as more positions remain open longer than intended, potentially impacting overall financial health and reducing user trust.

### PoC

Simulate a high gas environment or simply deploy a Gas-Consuming Contract:
User open a position and it becomes liquidatable
A liquidator attempts to liquidate the position using the liquidate function. The gas cost of the function becomes excessively high due to the gas-consuming receive function.
The liquidator observes that the gas cost is higher than the liquidation reward and decides not to execute the liquidation, leaving the position open and accruing further losses.


### Mitigation

Set a maximum gas limit for any token transfers or liquidations that involve user contracts to prevent excessively high gas costs.
Adjust the liquidation rewards dynamically based on network conditions. When gas prices are high, increase the rewards to ensure that liquidators remain incentivized to perform liquidations.
