# Imbalance of Reserves Due to Repeated Opening and Closing of Positions in Volatile Market Conditions

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/18ef2d8dc0162aca79bd71710f08a3c18c94a36e/gl-sherlock/contracts/core.vy#L230
When opening a position, the protocol locks a portion of the reserves as interest.
When closing a position, the close function applies deltas to update the pool state, including reserves and interest.
However, there's no check to ensure that the reserves remain balanced after multiple opens and closes, especially in volatile market conditions. An attacker can exploit the lack of checks to maintain balanced reserves by repeatedly opening and closing positions in a manner that depletes one type of reserve (e.g., base tokens) while accumulating an excess of another (e.g., quote tokens). Over time, this could lead to an imbalanced reserve ratio, jeopardizing the protocol’s stability and potentially resulting in losses for liquidity providers (LPs).

### Root Cause

The root cause is the lack of a mechanism to rebalance the reserves after position closes, especially in volatile market conditions. The protocol assumes that opens and closes will naturally balance out over time, but this assumption can be exploited in trending markets. , this could lead to creating an imbalance between the quote asset and the base asset. thus, the pool might not have
sufficient assets to pay traders when closing a position


### Internal pre-conditions

1.The protocol locks a portion of reserves as interest when opening a position.

### External pre-conditions

The market is volatile, with significant price movements expected. (bullish for the example)


### Attack Path

1.People identifu a market likely to trend strongly upward.
2.People opens a large long position, locking up a significant portion of the quote token reserves.
3.As the market moves up, the suers position gains value in terms of base tokens.
4.Users closes their position, returning more quote tokens to the pool than were originally locked.
5.This process is repeated multiple times, each time further imbalancing the pool's reserves.
Eventually, the pool has an excess of quote tokens and a shortage of base tokens.

### Impact

1.The pool's reserves become increasingly imbalanced, with an excess of quote tokens and a shortage of base tokens.
2.Liquidity providers face potential financial losses as the protocol’s reserve ratio becomes distorted, affecting their ability to withdraw or burn their LP tokens at fair value.
3.The imbalance in reserves can lead to a loss of stability for the protocol, causing price slippage, reducing liquidity, and decreasing the overall trust of the participants.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce checks to ensure that the reserve ratios remain balanced after every position close. If the reserves become imbalanced, apply corrective actions such as dynamic fees, liquidity rebalancing, or temporary suspension of certain operations to restore balance.
