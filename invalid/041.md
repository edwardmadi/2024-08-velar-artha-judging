# Traders can manipulate spread protection by exploiting position size omission in `api.vy::CONTEXT`

### Summary

The omission of position size in the [`CONTEXT` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L53-L71) will cause a bypass of spread protection for liquidity providers (LPs) as traders will open a small reverse position before their intended larger position, potentially causing financial losses for LPs.

### Root Cause

In `gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy`, the `[CONTEXT` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L53-L71) does not consider the size of the new position when calculating the price with the oracle.

Example:
- In [`api.vy:53-71`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L53-L71), the `CONTEXT` function does not include the position size in its price calculation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Trader needs to have sufficient funds to open both a reverse position and the intended larger position.
2. The pool must have enough liquidity to accommodate both positions.

### External pre-conditions

1. The oracle price needs to remain relatively stable during the execution of both `open()` calls.


### Attack Path

1. Trader calls `open()` in [`api.vy:131-158`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L131-L159) to set a small reverse position.
2. Trader immediately calls [`open()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/api.vy#L131-L159) again to set the intended larger position.

### Impact

The LPs suffer an increased risk of financial loss as the spread protection is bypassed, leading to potential manipulation of the trading mechanism. Traders gain an unfair advantage by effectively opening large positions without incurring the appropriate spread, which could result in significant losses for LPs over time.

### PoC

1. Assume the current price of ETH is $2000, and the spread for a 10 ETH position is 0.5%.
2. A trader wants to open a 10 ETH long position.
3. Instead of directly opening a 10 ETH long position (which would incur a 0.5% spread), the trader:
   - Opens a 1 ETH short position:
     ```python
     ctx: Ctx = self.CONTEXT(ETH, USDC, 2000 * 10**6, 10 * 10**6, payload)
     self.CORE.open(1, ETH, USDC, False, 2000 * 10**6, 1, ctx)
     ```
   - Immediately opens an 11 ETH long position:
     ```python
     ctx: Ctx = self.CONTEXT(ETH, USDC, 2000 * 10**6, 10 * 10**6, payload)
     self.CORE.open(1, ETH, USDC, True, 22000 * 10**6, 1, ctx)
     ```
4. The trader effectively opens a 10 ETH long position without incurring the 0.5% spread, saving $100 (0.5% of $20,000) at the expense of LPs.


### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the `CONTEXT` function should take into account the size of the new position when calculating the price. 

Additionally, the `open()` function in `api.vy` should be modified to pass the position size to `CONTEXT`.
