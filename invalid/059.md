# params.vy: dynamic_fees miscalculates by returning a percentage instead of a fee amount

### Summary

The function [`dynamic_fees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/params.vy#L33-L55) only calculates the percentage fee, but the fees.vy contract interprets this value as the actual fee amount.

### Root Cause

The [`dynamic_fees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-velar-artha/blob/main/gl-sherlock/contracts/params.vy#L33-L55) function calculates the fee by first calculating the ratio of tokens in used and total tokens:
```vyper
# long_utilization  = (pool.base_interest/ (pool.base_reserves/ 100))
long_utilization : uint256 = self.utilization(pool.base_reserves, pool.base_interest)
```

It than scales is based on the parameter `MAX_FEE`. So the value of `borrowing_long` is a value between 100 and 10. This is based on the sponsors suggested starting parameters (`MIN_FEE = 10`, `MAX_FEE = 100`):
```vyper
# borrowing_long = (self.PARAMS.MAX_FEE * long_utilization) / 100
# afterwards this is checked to be between MIN_FEE(10) and MAX_FEE(100) 
borrowing_long  : uint256 = self.check_fee(self.scale(self.PARAMS.MAX_FEE, long_utilization))
```

### Impact

Users pay significantly lower fees than expected, resulting in liquidity providers earning far less than intended.

### PoC

In this example, the pool contains 100,000 base tokens, and 50,000 tokens are being utilized. `MAX_FEE` is set to 100, as suggested by the sponsor for the launch parameters. We first scale the token amounts to 18 decimals:
- `pool.base_reserves` = 100,000 * 10**18
- `pool.base_interest`  =  50,000 * 10**18
- `self.PARAMS.MAX_FEE` = 100

Lets walk through the `dynamic_fees` calculation:
```vyper
def dynamic_fees(pool: PoolState) -> DynFees:
  [ ... ]
  # long_utilization  = (50,000 * 10**18) / ((100,000 * 10**18) / 100) = 50
  long_utilization : uint256 = self.utilization(pool.base_reserves, pool.base_interest)
  [ ... ]
  # self.scale = (100 * 50) / 100 = 50
  # self.check_fee(50) = 50
  borrowing_long   : uint256 = self.check_fee(self.scale(self.PARAMS.MAX_FEE, long_utilization))  
```

In this case the `borrowing_long` fee would be returned as 50. Given the size of the loan, this amount is too low to be reasonable. The result must be scaled to reflect the actual amount of tokens being utilized (`pool.base_interest`), as the value of 50 is only a relative figure scaled to 2 decimal places.

The correct fee should be calculated by multiplying the result (50) by the number of utilized base tokens:
```text
  (50,000 * 10**18) / 50 = 1,000 * 10 ** 18
```

Since this represents the fee for an entire year, we must divide the result by the total number of blocks in a year. The BOB chain has a block time of 2 seconds, meaning there are:
```text
  (365 * 24 * 60  * 60) / 2 = 15,768,000
```

Thus, the result should be divided as follows:
```text
  (1,000 * 10 ** 18) / 15,768,000= 1,000 * 10 ** 18 = 63,419,583,967,529 
```

The correct calculation would return 63,419,583,967,529 as the fee for this example, ensuring the fees are appropriately scaled for the actual amount of utilized tokens and distributed fairly across blocks.





### Mitigation

The contract should convert the percentage-based fee into an actual token amount to align with the expected behavior inside the `fees.vy` contract. This ensures that the fee is accurately calculated based on the number of tokens utilized. Below is an example of the necessary code change (diff):

Notice: This change adds 1 at the end of the conversion to prevent edge cases where the calculated fee is zero, which would prevent the position from being closed.

It is also advisable to replace the existing precision magic number (`100`) with a named constant for better readability and maintainability. Furthermore, updating the precision to support more decimals (e.g., using `1e18`, which is common for high-precision calculations in Ethereum-based contracts) would help to return a more accurate result.
